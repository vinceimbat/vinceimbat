# My Bio (120 words)

Vince Imbat uses images and text to explore what it means to be human in the intersection of material, mental, and virtual landscapes. When he was younger, he left a religious life only to find himself returning to the sublime through writing and photography. Today, Vince practices contemplative photography, digital gardening, and walking to create hybrid essays mapping the landscapes of Los Ba√±os, Baguio, and Pangasinan in the Philippines. He publishes his works and works-in-progress on a digital archive he calls "talahardin" (garden of notes). His hybrid image and text-based essay "Traversing Liminality Through Walking: An Autoethnography" landed him a spot at the 20th Ateneo National Writers Workshop (ANWW). For Vince, photography is a liberating, inquiring, and creative spiritual practice.

# What do you hope to learn at the workshops? (50 words)

I want to learn how to transform personal and abstract experiences and emotions, such as doubt, loneliness, or faith, into concrete images mirrored in physical form. I want to learn how to develop and present them to communicate stories that transform the personal into a socially and culturally relatable artifact.

***

Psychogeographic walking used as an aesthetic practice alongside urban photography have a strong Western history. I'm interested how these theories would stand when applied in a city in the developing world, such as Siem Reap. I'll be designing a series of multi-hour walks for several days while in the city taking photographs using psychogeographic techniques

openness
unanticipated encounters
materialities and rhythms of the city
spatial and temporal variations
new ways of looking at the city
exploring the aesthetic politics of cities

how urban space is used and by whom

What will be my leading question?

Method?
- psychogeographic photography

Subjects
- individual objects
- landscapes
