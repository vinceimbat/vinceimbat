Psychogeographic walking used as an aesthetic practice alongside urban photography have a strong Western history. I'm interested how these theories would stand when applied in a city in the developing world, such as Siem Reap. I'll be designing a series of multi-hour walks for several days while in the city taking photographs using psychogeographic techniques

openness
unanticipated encounters
materialities and rhythms of the city
spatial and temporal variations
new ways of looking at the city
exploring the aesthetic politics of cities

how urban space is used and by whom

What will be my leading question?

Method?
