Just a thought: What constitutes a "win" in my standards and understanding? I feel like it should be an insight, experience, or achievement that had far-reaching results to other areas of my life.

Here, I remember something Lea said, I think from Sahara Rose's book about when one knows one's path, all other things are just extra. There are a lot of things that happened in 2022. Pretty experiences. But all of them are just extras compared to the big realizations. Because truth-seeking is my path, my source of self-actualization.
