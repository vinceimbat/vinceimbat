How can we extend a gift community to an entire world?

Perhaps there are communities in some parts of the world who have achieved this, but even indigenous populations have exclusivismâ€”a concept of people being part of the tribe and those that are not.

In my case, it is easier to feel this gift feeling to my immediate family, but harder to my extended family. How much more to my friends and my outer community?

Our reservations to extend the gift to people who are less related to us arises from a lack of a strong bond in the first place. But for any chance of a bond to be created, one or both parties need to take a leap of faith and extend the gift because [[A gift begins a non-existing relationship]].
