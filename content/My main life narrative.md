What is the main question: How should I live?

What is the main narrative:

I grew up as JW. I went through a life-changing depression. I left my religion. I lost my worldview, purpose, and community. I am left looking to build my own worldview and life from the ground up. What happens after?

Method:

My writing should jump freely between

1. Witnessing myself
	- confronting my past
2. Witnessing the objective physical reality
	- getting closer with place (what is in front of me)
	- geography
3. Witnessing the other
	- Presenting culture
	- presenting history
