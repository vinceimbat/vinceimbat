This is Daniel Kokotajlo's debut film. I was stunned by its accuracy. It wasn't particularly moving as that Vox documentary. But the accuracy, particularly of the acting, was superb.

I see my younger sister in Alex, and even my younger self, somehow. We obeyed. "Masunurin" as Bro. Domingo once said.

I remember now, Papa did support me after I had depression. For more than a year, he would drive me even to Urdaneta during meetings. But it was late. I was already losing faith at that time.

This really has to be a memoir. Someday somehow I should write this, not necessarily for anyone but most importantly for myself.

Book idea: [[Rewalking Baguio]]
