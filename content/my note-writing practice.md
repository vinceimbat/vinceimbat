If I don't have to work on a project during the writing block of the uninterrupted morning block of [[my daily routine]], I jump right into the core of my creative practice: writing inside the [[talahardin]]. I do my writing in the morning to take the most advantage of the clarity and focus I usually have after a good sleep.

Notes with the tag [[seedlings]] appear automatically on my daily note in [[Obsidian]]. I work on them that day. After this, I scout my [[writing inbox]] for any unfinished note, essay, or poem and work on them.

If I am running out of notes to work on, I need to generate more prompts through the following:

1. I review and process at least two previous [[diary]] entries and see if I could generate new prompts from them.
2. I review and process [[seeds]] (snippets taken during a walk). I begin with yesterday then move my way backwards.
3. I review insight notes.
4. I review literature notes.

Throughout this process, my main goal is to move seeds and seedlings to [[evergreens]]. Evergreen notes are important so I have the building blocks I could use to create larger artifacts (see [[my creative artifacts]]). Evergreen thought notes, for example, are determine evergreen essay production and, more importantly, inform my project for [[intentional living]]. I strive to process at least one note every day.

By the end of my session, I push changes in my forest garden to its public version powered by [[Quartz]] and Github.

After this, I read. I attempt to read at least one page from a book or an article each day. If the material is theoretical, I make highlights, which I process into literature notes later ([[how to write literature notes]]).
