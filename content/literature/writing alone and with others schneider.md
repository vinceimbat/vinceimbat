# An aesthetic of trust

Trust in the inherent talent in people and trust in the power of writing as a process.

# The three realms of writing

the nature of writ- ing, of art, and of personal experience

# AWA's five essential affirmations

1. Everyone has a strong, unique voice.
2. Everyone is born with creative genius.
3. Writing as an art form belongs to all people, regardless of economic class or educational level.
4. The teaching of craft can be done without damage to a writer’s original voice or artistic self-esteem.
5. A writer is someone who writes.

# AWA's five essential practices

1. A nonhierarchical spirit (how we treat writing) in the workshop is maintained while at the same time an appropriate discipline (how we interact as a group) keeps writers safe.
2. Confidentiality about what is written in the workshop is maintained, and the privacy of the writer is protected. All writing is treated as fiction unless the writer requests that it be treated as autobiography. At all times writers are free to refrain from reading their work aloud.
3. Absolutely no criticism, suggestion, or question is directed toward the writer in response to first-draft, just-written work. A thorough critique is offered only when the writer asks for it and distributes work in manuscript form. Critique is balanced; there is as much affirmation as suggestion for change.
4. The teaching of craft is taken seriously and is conducted through exercises that invite experimentation and growth as well as through response to manuscripts and in private conferences.
5. The leader writes along with the participants and reads that work aloud at least once in each writing session. This practice is absolutely necessary, for only in this way is there equality of risk-taking and mutuality of trust.

# Focus of a writing practice

Writing, taking the writer seriously as an artist, and insisting on the bottom line—good work.

# Working on writing is more than just trying to judge quality

# Writers have an essential need for privacy to do their best work

# Writers have an essential need for audience and colleagues

# Writing is about freedom to go wherever you need to go

A writing group is not a therapy group—it is concerned with liberating the artist in the person.

# Writing is always political

“the issue is not whether our writing will be political. If we are silent, our silence is political. If we write, our writing is political.”

“the privilege of voice carries with it a responsibility to speak for social justice”

# The depths of your consciousness is the source of your most powerful words

the main theme or force of the book: going deep.

learning to take the risk of going to the most powerful insights, memories, perceptions, and feelings that one has (or rather, that one mostly doesn’t yet quite have)—as a source of one’s most powerful words.

# Writing groups require wisdom and firm leadership

There are crucial guidelines and rules of thumb that at least one person needs to take responsibility for. Otherwise people are likely to take ad- vantage of each other, give feedback that’s not helpful, and abuse each other’s privacy.

any dedicated person can lead a writers’ group—as long as they are vigilant about enforcing these guidelines of respect.

# Writing group vs. workshop

She distinguishes the role of a writing group leader from the role of a workshop leader. A writing group leader is vigilant to keep the group safe for the writing process. A workshop leader does that but also offers trained guidance in writing, editing, and seeking publication.

# Aspire to center in your voice and experience

I deliberately did not reread Peter’s books (except to dip in here or there occasionally), needing to stay centered in my own voice and experience.

# Using the book for writers who write alone

If you are a writer working alone (and every member of a workshop or a class is also a writer who writes alone), I suggest that you first read Part I, “The Writer Alone,” following the exercise suggestions if they interest you, and then go to Part III, “Additional Exercises.”

# Using the book for workshop or group leaders or teachers

If you are a workshop or group leader, a teacher, or someone who would like to gather other writers to write together, read Part I for the benefit of your own writing and to acquaint yourself with this method. Then read Part II, “Writing with Others.”

Part III will give you resources for leading varied exercises.

# Using the book to help disempowered people

If you are a person who wants to use writing to empower people whose voices have been silenced by poverty, illness, incarceration, or other hard- ship, I hope you will read the entire book. First tend to the writer in your- self by writing in response to the exercises that beckon to you in Part I, then read Part II about the workshop method as it is used with writers who have a standard formal education and (usually) can pay a fee for the group experience.

creating a different sort of writing community—one that is specifically designed to work for healing the broken world.

# Everyone is a writer

Everyone is a writer. You are a writer.

Those who do not write stories and poems on solid surfaces tell them, sing them, and, in so doing, write them on the air. Creating with words is our continuing pas- sion. We dream stories; we make up stories, poems, songs, and tell them to ourselves. All alone, we write.

It may not be committed to paper, but the artist, the writer, is at work.

Art is not just the province of the privileged. Art belongs to the people.

Even if you don’t talk easily to others, but spin out stories in your own head—if you talk to yourself—you can write. You are already an artist; all you have to do is take up your pen and begin.

What I believe is not believed by everyone, and it is not practiced by everyone who believes it! It is this: There is no place for hierarchies in the heart, and the making of art is a matter of the heart. Art is the creative expression of the human spirit, and it cannot—it must not, for the sake of the human community—be limited to those few who achieve critical acclaim or financial reward.

John Gardner wrote, “Genius is as common as old shoes. Everybody has it.”

Genius is hidden everywhere; it is in every person, waiting to be evoked, enabled, supported, celebrated. It is in you. It is in me. Shakespeare wrote Shakespeare’s vision. Dickinson wrote Dickinson’s. Who will write yours, if you do not?

there is just one contribution which every one of us can make: we can give into the common pool of experience some comprehension of the world as it looks to each of us... . If you can tell a story as it can appear only to you of all the people on earth, you will inevitably have a piece of work which is original. (Dorothea Brande)

Art is essential to all of us because every human being is born a creator

All people are writers who can, if they so desire, claim their writing as a personal (and perhaps public) art form.

I cannot teach anyone to be an artist, but then I don’t have to because everyone is already an artist. Real teachers everywhere know this.

You are a writer. You are an artist. Accept it, celebrate it, and practice it for the rest of your life.

# Writing connects us

We also write with others.

We are all connected to one another and to the mystery at the heart of the universe through our strange and marvelous ability to create words. When we write, we create, and when we offer our creation to one another, we close the wound of loneliness and may participate in healing the broken world. Our words, our truth, our imagining, our dreaming, may be the best gifts we have to give.

# To write deeply one needs a safe environment

You can write as deeply as you think—but only if you are safe enough, if you can forget yourself enough. If you can “let go” and tell the truth of what you have experienced or imagined, you can write.

But what is that recognizable genius made of? Safety, self-confidence, focus, and practice. These factors enable one to reach further, go deeper, and take greater risks than is possible for a person trapped in fear and self-protection.

Genius often emerges where there is intimate support for it.

Neither of them was seen by their contemporaries as being greatly gifted. It seems truly important that there be a community of support around the artist that protects the making of the art.

Where there is no intimate support, there is often the driving force of suffering, creating an intense personal isolation, a kind of solitude, out of which the voice of genius arises. Each of us has genius, but we need support, and we can give it to one another as friends or in honest and supportive workshop settings.

# Writer's block is a learned disability

Not being able to write is a learned disability. It is almost always the result of scar tissue, of disbelief in yourself accumulated as a result of unhelpful responses to your writing. Those wounds can be healed, those blocks can be removed.

Not to be able to write is a learned disability, taught to us in school and at home, imprinted on us in letters: “F,” “D,” “C-minus.”

# Commercial success in writing is not always driven by art

Being commercially successful is a very good thing: We all like to eat! But a commercially successful writer may or may not be working as an artist. That is, sometimes one can make a lot of money repeating oneself, or writing for reasons other than those of making art. Rarely is an artist rewarded with fame and fortune, but commercial success is often a matter of entrepreneurship, luck, and a craft appropriate to the marketplace.

# Craft vs. Art

Craft is essential; I will work all my life at my craft. But craft is not the same thing as art. Craft is the knowledge of how to mix blue with yellow on my palette, but art is the courage to dip the brush into the paint and lay it on the canvas in my own way. Craft is knowing when to revise a manuscript and when to leave it alone, but art is the fire in the mind that put the story on the page in the first place. To grow in craft is to increase the breadth of what I can do,

# Art is the courage to be yourself

but art is the depth, the passion, the desire, the courage to be myself and myself alone, to communicate what I and only I can communicate: that which I have experienced or imagined.

I hear fear and hope and longing. I do not hear any garbage. I hear passion. I hear desire. And when they begin speaking in the mother tongue of their own voices, mining the mother lode of their own stories, the material they and they alone know “by heart,” I hear art.

Whether your purpose is artistic expression, communication with friends and family, the healing of the inner life, or achieving public recognition for your art—the foun- dation is the same: the claiming of yourself as an artist/writer and the strengthening of your writing voice through practice, study, and helpful (as opposed to damaging) communication with others.

# Empower the voice of those who've been denied a voice

Those whose language skills are impaired nevertheless have a story, and if it can be told in the unique and idiosyncratic form of the author’s own way with words, it can be brilliant. If we valued the voices of those who have been denied a voice, we would have a canon of literature so much more diverse, interesting, and humane than the canon we do have.

Some critics claim that all truly great works of literature are already recognized. What a cynical and small-minded view of the human spirit!

I have never heard a word of garbage in any workshop of mine!

# Writing is therapy

Many famous writers have acknowledged that the line between writing as an artistic act and as an act of personal healing is a thin line indeed.

Writing as therapy and writing as an artistic act may be the same act. Whether or not writing heals the writer is irrelevant. What matters is the power of the work itself.

# Not publishing one's works is okay

But I am also pleased with many that will never be read except by the writer’s friends. Those works will never be offered to the public because the writer is too shy; too uncertain of her or his own abilities; too awkward at making contacts; too busy to send off manuscripts; too bruised by academic grading systems and hos- tile teacher responses to endure “rejections”; or too poor to pay the endless postage, copying costs, and telephone bills that are the start-up costs of writing as an entrepreneurial business. The fact that excellent work is unpublished does not diminish its artistry. The list of writers who, like Emily Dickinson, were undiscovered and unappreciated until long after they died is long. It isn’t difficult to imagine all those whose papers were lost forever by relatives who were not as careful or as diligent as Emily’s sister, Vinnie.

# Some art works are meant for an intimate audience

In other times and other cultures, art was made for the family: quilts, hand-carved pieces, lullabies, ballads. The audience for that art was intimate. In a good writing workshop, some exquisite work is given to and received by an intimate audience.

# The value of art is not monopolized by the commercial world or the academy

Writing is making art, and the test of its value cannot be given into the hands of either the commercial world or the academy.

# Writing is only facilitated, not taught

Those of us who teach—really teach—know that we are simply midwives to that which is already within our students. Our task is only this: to pre- pare a place, to welcome, to receive, and to encourage. Our task is the midwife’s task: We help prepare the newborn for presentation. With a newborn text, as with a newborn baby, this may mean some cleaning, some dressing up (that’s craft). But the life, the spirit of the newborn, is already there (that’s art).

“Teaching” is mostly showing what has been done before, not so that it should be copied, but so that options are known, that derivative work is recognized, and that all that has preceded us is available as foundation or as reference point. Sometimes, if I am careful, I can help an artist recog- nize her or his own unique voice and come to trust it. But each of us has to claim this alone: I am an artist. I am a writer.

# A writer is someone who writes

“A writer is someone who writes,” wrote William Stafford.

# Your tasks as a writer or artist

1. Give your art/writing time.
2. Sound more and more like yourself.
3. Experiment, play, take risks, be brave.
4. Believe in the freshness, vitality, and importance of your own experience and imagination.
5. Practice in ways that will teach you to recognize your own voice and to increase its range
6. Believe in yourself as an artist-in-training, and protect yourself from everyone and everything that undermines that belief.
7. Observe.
8. Remember.
9. Imagine.
10. Find and keep in contact with other writer/artists who can pro- vide you with an intimate community of support, give you honest critical response, strengthen you, and encourage your work.

# Insights

Treat your writing practice like your free religions (perhaps everything!): begin somewhere but let yourself change and get to places until you reach something where you can settle down. Now that I think about it, this is exactly how to design a life: try different things, let yourself be guided by your curiosity, and then commit when needed.
