To survive and progress, a religion has to be a religion appropriate for the future.

To become appropriate for the future, a religion has to let go of or change its words, concepts, and practices if necessary.

However, a religion has to change slowly, avoiding introducing words, concepts, and practices that haven't acquired collective meaning.

To change, adherents of a religion must first claim the freedom to be who they are today.

Our religious tradition is a reservoir of the past that we can dig to find its future. To dig it, we have to see this past as unfinished and open for more interpretation.
- See Bloch (1995), *Principle of hope*, 1, 200.
- “to keep the past unfinished, refusing to accept its appearance of closure as the final word, springing it open once again by rewriting its apparent fatality under the sign of freedom,” Eagleton (2015), *Hope without optimism*, 32. 

To be free, we need to practice Gianni Vattimo's "weak thought."
- Research this further.

We change a religion and make it freer not through a destructive revolutionary moment (*überwindung*) but through weak, subtle, and creative ways that reinterpret and transform it (*verwindung*).
- “Nothing in the world is soft and weak as water. But when attacking the hard and strong, nothing can conquer so easily. Weak overcomes strong, soft overcomes hard” (Tao Te Ching, 78)

I

I continue to be an advocate of remaining clear that we are a community that is slowly but consciously emerging from, and seeking to reform and reinterpret the language and practices of the [liberal Christian](https://www.google.com/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=liberal+Christian&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8) and [Radical Enlightenment](https://blogs.princeton.edu/librarian/2014/01/radical-enlightenment-in-brief/) tradition, and to do it in ways which help us continue to claim the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today.

religion as both debate and way of life has not crumbled in the face of an apparently inexorable rationalist, scientific, modernising Enlightenment and globalisation of the market economy” and, contrary to most liberal expectations, religion has “retain[ed] a potency and strength which remains far in excess of its ability to explain” ([Thompson's introduction to Ernst Bloch’s “Atheism in Christianity”, Verso Press 2009, p. ix](https://www.versobooks.com/books/378-atheism-in-christianity)). Surely, we need to have continued access to — or at least a living understanding of — this potency and strength if we are going to have a genuine chance of helping to direct religion in liberal and progressive directions

if we can find ways to keep the past _present_ and consciously to engage with it in a dialectical conversational way through a process of _“verwindung”_, carried out with the patience of water upon stone then, in time, we stand a real chance of truly escaping many of our old and, to my mind, highly damaging religious thoughts and practices and so able to move into a genuinely new liberal and progressive religious way of being in the world.

_“The philosophers have only described the world in various ways; the moment now has arrived to interpret it”_ ([Gianni Vattimo and Santiago Zabala: in “Hermeneutic Communism — From Heidegger to Marx”, Columbia University Press, New York 2011, p. 5](http://cup.columbia.edu/book/hermeneutic-communism/9780231158039)).

most of us know only too well that our inherited religious traditions and their strong objective structures (such as, for example, the idea of a supernatural, supreme being or the various institutions of an organised, hierarchical church) desperately need to be overcome. Despite this, however, Vattimo is, as am I, in agreement with Heidegger when he said, “Overcoming is worthy only when we think about incorporation” ([Martin Heidegger: “Overcoming Metaphysics” in the “End of Philosophy”, trans J. Stambaugh, Harpur and Row, New York 1973, p. 91](https://www.google.co.uk/books/edition/The_End_of_Philosophy/g6zu4kkQ9kYC?hl=en)).

the religion we have in the here and now on our own bend of the river (whatever and wherever it is) need never be allowed to be taken simply, “as it is” but can always be taken, as [Walter Benjamin (1892-1940)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walter_Benjamin) noted, as being “fluid, labile and suspended” (quoted in Terry Eagleton: “Hope without Optimism”, Yale UP, New Haven 2015, p. 32).

we need to begin to see that our inherited religion is something always capable of being radically, yet gently, reinterpreted and surpassed so that it can continue to gift us things intensely valuable and meaningful, things both new and old.

“every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the head of a household who brings out of their treasury what is new and what is old” (Matthew 13:52).

I want to suggest that, by a process of _verwindung_ and using weak thought, there can always be found in our past traditions still undischarged futures which can be released. This is because our past traditions are not what we usually think they are, i.e completely done and dusted, instead, they’re always unfinished and radically open. This, in turn, means, as Eagleton notes, we need to become aware that “the meaning of past events lies ultimately in the guardianship of the present” (Terry Eagleton: “Hope without Optimism”, Yale UP, New Haven 2015, p. 32).

how we might become ourselves modern equivalents of scribes of the kingdom of heaven? That is to say, people who are truly able to affect the guardianship of the present and, through the use of weak thought and _verwindung,_ are truly able to claim the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today.

scribes are made not born. They are only slowly formed in community through a long, self-conscious, disciplined educational practice

one of the most pressing things required of contemporary liberal religion in the here and now is not to be seduced into trying to make some putative religion of the future right at this moment of time but of making and shaping contemporary liberal religious subjects who, like Jesus, are highly skilled at being able to bring out of their treasury what is new and what is old. They will be the ones who are then able to build a liberal religion genuinely suitable for the future.

I have consistently tried to encourage people to become the kind of “Free Spirits” promoted by [Friedrich Nietzsche (1844-1900)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friedrich_Nietzsche) and to combine this with becoming what the twentieth-century poet [Charles Olson (1910-1970)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Olson) called “Archeologists of Morning.” Additionally, I have long believed, that this can help people become what the philosopher [Paul Wienpahl (1916-1980)](http://texts.cdlib.org/view?docId=hb1j49n6pv&doc.view=frames&chunk.id=div00110&toc.depth=1&toc.id=) called men and women without a position, i.e. people truly free to live creatively and compassionately in the ever-moving, [intra-active](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SnstJoEec) world in which all of us live, move, and have our being.

"Free Spirit"

a therapeutic journey that unfolded in four phases.

"Waking to Wonder" by Gordon Bearn

the therapeutic journey started with "the [hearth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearth) health" of our old inherited, supernatural religious and metaphysical traditions

These inherited traditions, even though they once grounded and secured for us the things we thought were of the highest value, today often "fetter us the fastest", keeping us bound to old ways and beliefs which are simply no longer working for us

it is the recognition of the loss of our "hearth health" -- whenever and however it comes -- that brings on the second phase of the therapeutic journey, one in which we enter a time of profound sickness, the dreadful sickness of nihilism in which there is "the hateful assault on everything that had seemed so comforting." It's a time when nothing counts any longer, when everything seems utterly meaningless and there is left only anomie and emptiness.

because going through this sickness helps begin to loosen the fetters that once bound us, it is not a sickness to be feared because it plays an important role in helping us enter into the third phase of the therapeutic journey, namely, a period of freeing and transformative convalescence which itself has two phases--one cool, one warm.

The cool phase of convalescence is one of detachment in which we find we are once again able to look upon the world and all the things it contains, no longer nihilistically, but in a detached, scholarly fashion

The warm phase of convalescence is begun when we recognise that if our convalescence is truly to continue then we must find ways to return from the chilly heights and somehow come back to earth "where the sun warms."

But, you might object, is not this warmth, this bloom and magic of things close and closest to us, merely an indication of a return by another route to the old hearth heath? Not at all, because you cannot ever fully forget the experience of the transformative sickness of nihilism; neither can you fully forget the chilly, detached perspective of the world seen during the first period of your convalescence. You are by now a significantly changed and still changing creature.

Naturally, these moments of warmth are, at first, short-lived and your mood of chilly but tender contempt will, from time to time, most assuredly return. It is also the case that, like malaria or lyme disease, the hateful sickness of nihilism may also return now and then, perhaps laying you low for weeks, if not for months, on end. Yet, for all that, you begin to notice that the occasional moments of warm sunlight come and stay more frequently than they used to.

On your best days, as Bearn observes, you are now able to live "as neighbour to precisely the things that the metaphysical tradition only found valuable as indicators of another metaphysical world" (Gordon Bearn: "Waking to Wonder", SUNY Press, New York 1997, p. 32) and you begin to see, as Heidegger saw, that "When we live in the firsthand world around us, everything comes at us loaded with meaning, all over the place and all the time. Everything is within the world [of meaningfulness]: the world holds forth" ([cited in "What, after all, was Heidegger about?", Thomas Sheehan, 2014 p. 8](https://blogs.helsinki.fi/nosp-2014/files/2014/04/2014-WHAT-AFTER-ALL-WAS-HEIDEGGER-ABOUT-HELSINKI.pdf)). This, in turn, reveals to us a startling and hopeful truth beautifully summed up by Thomas Sheehan, that "there is nowhere else for a human being to live except in meaning" (ibid. p. 8).

In this warm convalescent phase, a person begins ever more fully to understand that we don't need another supernatural, metaphysical world to underwrite and give meaning to our life in this world; all that is required is that we see **_this_** world differently and have the courage to remain with the close and closest things, things that, astonishingly, are now acquiring for us such bloom and magic.

For Nietzsche, all this gives us the hope of eventually entering into the "great health" which is the fourth and final phase of the therapeutic journey, one in which a person is able, at least ideally, to live completely and fully in these moments of natural warmth throughout the remainder of their life. As Bearn says, "This spirit freed from the tradition that seeks metaphysical comforts is surprised by a new happiness and a new love for all that is delicate. The great health is a life attuned to what is near." And, as Ralph Waldo Emerson put it, and which Nietzsche quoted on the title page of the first edition of ["The Gay Science"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Gay_Science): "To the poet, to the philosopher, to the saint, all things are friendly and sacred, all events profitable, all days holy, all men [sic] divine" ([Emerson: "History"](https://archive.vcu.edu/english/engweb/transcendentalism/authors/emerson/essays/history.html)).

My own hope has long been that the more and more we come to understand ourselves as pilgrim, convalescent Free Spirits, the better able we are to become what the twentieth-century poet [Charles Olson (1910-1970)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Olson) called "Archaeologists of Morning"

III

1952 called "Present is Prologue" ([in "Collected Prose" eds. Donald Allen and Benjamin Friedlander, University of California Press, Berkley 1997, p. 205-207](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520208735/collected-prose)) the poet [Charles Olson (1910-1970)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Olson)

suggested that we need to come to see that the past is for us not quite what we usually think it is. To the extent that we have access to the past, the past is, in fact, something present to us and it is this "past-as-present" that is the prologue of our unfolding, creative life.

a kind of "perpetual morning".

For Olson, the past is available to us in only two living ways and it's important to realise that both ways are available to us **_only in the present_**, in this perpetual morning. Keeping in mind Olson's image of the archaeologist, on this perpetual morning, it is into the soil of the "past-as-present" that he is encouraging us to do our digging.

everything we call, identify and have available to us as "the past", as "history", is something which we are always-already carrying with us right now, in the present on this perpetual morning.

Olson suggests that the past is available to us in two living ways.

He calls the first available past "our own" history and he notes that "the work of each of us is to find out the true lineament of ourselves by facing up to the primal features of these founders who lie buried in us". The point he is making here is that his dead parents and, by extension, all the past people, things ideas and events that are our founders--those things which have made us who were are--all these are only available to us in the perpetual morning of the here and now, buried in the soil of our own present personal and cultural memories. It is into this present ground, earth or perpetual morning into which we, as archaeologists of morning, are to dig.

The second available past is, according to Olson, not "our own". It is a somewhat allusive "past"

I take Olson here to be gesturing towards the powerful natural, animating and "raging" fluxes and flows of matter/energy in constant motion that are buried within, and simultaneously revealed, in every aspect of our being. Like a [foundling child](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/foundling), we have been gifted these fluxes and flows from who knows what parent and by and through them every living and non-living thing is constantly being made and unmade in the perpetual morning of the present.

Olson's "raging apart" is a natural phenomenon that is manifest in, for example, the seed becoming a flower or a tree, in the caterpillar becoming a butterfly or, like Olsen, in the poet's desire to make a poem, [_poeisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poiesis)_. It is a reminder that matter/energy is always affective in and of itself and so never requires an external prime, unmoved mover, such as the god of theism, to get things going

the work of the morning "is methodology: how to use oneself, and on what"

it is only by digging in the soil that is this perpetual morning that we can genuinely come, not only to be the kinds of beings we might most fully be, but also to understand what it means to be that kind of being. This, Olson the poet tells us, is his "profession" and it is why he proclaims himself "an archaeologist of morning."

Olson thought archaeologists of morning were the type of people always getting on with it, digging deep into the present soil of ourselves and the world, now, in this instant, with no drag and ourselves as the only reader and mover of the instant, freed from all restrictive theories and creeds.

the "work and dogmas" of such a free, morning way of being-in-the-world were three-fold.

**The first work and dogma (necessary know-how) is "How by form, to get the content instant". By this Olson means he wants us to create things where the form they take perfectly, and immediately, expresses the content; where our poetry, music, acts of social justice and worship, are the fullest possible expressions of ourselves and not merely inauthentic, arty or moralistic clothing.**

The second work and dogma (necessary know-how) is "what any of us are by the work on ourself, how to make ourselves fit instruments for use (how we augment the given--what used to be called our fate)". Here, I take it that Olson is tapping into a sacred energy that helps us not to succumb to despair and inaction in the face of deeply challenging, contingent events. Olson sees clearly that we can always augment that which we are given.

The third work and dogma (necessary know-how) is to assert that "there is no such thing as duality either of the body and the soul or of the world and I, that the fact in the human universe is the discharge of the many (the multiple) by the one (yrself [sic] done right, whatever you are, in whatever job)." Olson goes on to say that this helps us see that "all hierarchies, like dualities, are dead ducks." Here, I take it that he is tapping into a second sacred energy that is able to challenge our dangerous tendency to hubris which always threatens to make us believe we are individual, independent creatures wholly in control of our existence and unfolding life.

But let us be clear, like all free-spirited archaeologists of morning (or, indeed, archaeologists of any kind), we can never be absolutely sure beforehand precisely what, if anything, we are going to bring to light that is both old and new from the soil into which we must dig. All we can, and need be assured of is that, to paraphrase a well-known hymn, in the perpetual morning there is always-already more light and truth that can break forth from the past, light and truth that is both old and new.

IV

So, to conclude, what do I think is the result of becoming a free spirit who is also an archaeologist of morning?

a "man [or woman] without a position."

_"As I see it, the point is not to identify reality with anything except itself. (Tautologies are, after all, true.) If you wish to persist by asking what reality is; that is, what is really, the answer is that it is what you experience it to be. Reality is as you see, hear, feel, taste and smell it, and as you live it. And it is a multifarious thing. To see this is to be a man without a position. To get out of the mind and into the world, to get beyond language and to the things is to cease to be an idealist or a pragmatist, or an existentialist, or a Christian. I am a man without a position. I do not have the philosophic position that there are no positions or theories or standpoints. (There obviously are.) I am not a sceptic or an agnostic or an atheist. I am simply a man without a position, and this should open the door to detachment"_ (["An Unorthodox Lecture", 1956](http://www.manasjournal.org/pdf_library/VolumeIX_1956/IX-24.pdf)).

one simply cannot know exactly what one is going to find as one begins to dig nor, indeed, if on this or that particular day of digging one will find or notice anything of interest at all. One must simply start to dig and see what emerges from the soil and, in what this process will fully consist, can never be fully worked out beforehand. To be sure one can bring certain pre-existing ideas, perspectives, methods and tools to the initial breaking of the ground but they are there simply to help us to begin to dig which, in turn, may well reveal something that requires new ideas, methods, perspectives and tools if it is to be excavated and interpreted as well and as fully as is possible. The actual experience of being right there with the close and closest things_ _as one actually digs into reality is what drives everything here. As one proceeds one must use all one's senses because reality is always as you see, hear, feel, taste and smell it, and as you live it, and these senses are there to help provide as many perspectives as is possible to uncover and interpret what is truly there, even as one must remain acutely aware that full scope always eludes our grasp, that there is no finality of vision, that we have perceived nothing completely, and that tomorrow, like a new walk, a new dig is always a new dig.

As Wienpahl says, the point is not to identify reality with anything except itself._ _However, we need to remain fully aware that reality is a multifarious thing and it is to see this, _**truly to see this**_, that is to be a man or a woman without a position. The free-spirit-archaeologist-of-morning-without-a-position is always seeking to get out of the mind and into the world, to get beyond language and to the things. And, when one is doing this well, one ceases to be an idealist, a pragmatist, an existentialist, a Christian, a sceptic, an agnostic, or an atheist. Instead, one becomes a man or a woman without a position, someone who is not bringing to bear upon reality a ready-made, fixed blueprint but someone who, through a process of disciplined attentiveness to, and mindfulness of, things, is able to get the content of themselves instant, with no drag and so able to remain as fully open as is possible to what is actually [intra-actively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SnstJoEec&t=46s) emerging as one digs into the soil of the past-as-present on this perpetual morning. This is the kind of detachment which, as a man without a position, Wienpal sought.

This task done well is precisely what guarantees our freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today.

the past is not something which is finished and which fixes us and holds us back, something completely done and dusted, instead, they can see that within the past there are always-already undischarged energies and futures that can be released to the present and which can help us live better, fuller and more creative lives than we did before. Freer lives . . .

we need to be aware that there is a real difference between being someone without a _**position**_ and being someone without a _**direction**_.

It's important to see that to live in the world without a fixed position is, in fact, a prerequisite of being able truly to follow the direction of reality as it is actually unfolding and then of being able truly to augment the given.

it is only the man or woman without a position who is able to surf the crest of the ever-moving unfolding wave of reality.

the surfboard is acting as their "door to detachment" which allows them to have a direction that genuinely accords with the reality of the wave's actual unfolding which, of course, includes the unfolding life of this surfer [intra-acting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SnstJoEec&t=46s) with the unfolding of the wave.

Like surfers, the man or woman without a position is able to surf the constantly unfolding crest of the perpetual morning.

getting out of the mind and into the world, to get beyond language and to the things.

I always try to pick up my camera and go out into the world without a ready-made, fully worked-out blueprint, theory or plan about how, when or where to take a photograph. In this sense, what the surfboard is to the surfer, the camera is to me the photographer. In doing this I'm attempting to keep myself open to whatever whooshes-up or shines before me, whether that is in the form of an obvious "subject", "view", or a simple passing play of sunlight and shadow. When something does whoosh-up or shines before me, I stop and take a photograph. To do this I must, of course, temporarily "take a position." Not only by standing still in this or that place but also by taking a position with regard to the camera settings I am going to use, the f-stop, the shutter speed, film speed and whether to shoot in black and white or colour. Now, were I never to take this or that position with regard to all these things, I would never be able to take any photo (good or bad). However, it is vitally important that, having taken a photograph, I never become wholly wedded to this or that particular position, subject, view, passing play of sunlight and shadow or this or that set of settings--instead, I must move on, [intra-actively](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v0SnstJoEec&t=46s), on the crest of the unfolding world, to attain another perspective and so allow something else to whoosh-up or shine before me which calls me to shoot, click!

It has long struck me that taken together all the foregoing offers the world an example of what, [in his famous essay called "Walking", Henry David Thoreau (1817-1862)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walking_\(Thoreau\)) called the "newer testament--the Gospel according to this moment".

It's the only gospel I know of that helps us truly to claim the freedom to be tomorrow what we are not today and, because of this, in my work as a rather unconventional minister of religion, it is the only gospel that I am able to live by and proclaim with a genuinely clean heart and full belief (_pathos_).

Contemplating positionlessness

- most things are arguably changeable
- although some things like one's past and body are difficult or unchangeable
- but our "position" (i.e., stand on matters) are changeable. They're not fixed. And it's important to remember that we can change our ideas and beliefs and don't have to keep those that no longer work.
- one can even take this position-less stand or more accurately a stand that premises on a freedom to change one's position anytime to adapt to reality
