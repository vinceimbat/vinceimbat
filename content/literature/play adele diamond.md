What a listen!

The field of Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience is releasing a plethora of evidence that children and adults alike learn best when they are "fully engaged" in learning experiences - something that challenges the old methods of teaching (like passively listening to a lecture).

Play, travel, art, music, the outdoors...

These are better teachers because we use all parts of our brain - including the emotional limbic system - and augment these through our bodies.

In short, play is are more effective way to learn because it is more holistic, more true to who we fully are.

QUIT STRESSING CHILDREN. LET THEM PLAY INSTEAD.

"...that’s such a shame. School should be joyful. Why not? Then the children will want to be there. You learn more. Your brain works better. Your prefrontal cortex goes offline if you’re stressed, even mildly stressed. So the more you stress children in school the worse their executive function is going to be and the worse their higher cognitive functions are going to work. They work better if they’re not stressed, if they’re happy. And you can do things joyfully or you can do things making somebody miserable. Why not do it joyfully?"
