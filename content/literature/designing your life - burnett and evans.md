## Reframe dysfunctional beliefs

Dysfunctional beliefs prevent so many people from designing the life they want.

Reframing questions and problems is one of the most important mind-sets of a designer.

Examples of dysfunctional beliefs:
- Your degree determines your career. Reframe: 3/4 of all collefe grads don't end up working in a career related to their majors.
- True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you. Reframe: True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you.

## Encore career

An “encore” career involves work that combines personal meaning, continued income, and social impact.

## Design thinking might be the best approach in living life

When emotions are involved, design thinking has proved to be the best problem-solving tool.

Aesthetics is the ultimate design problem as it involves human emotion.

Life can’t be perfectly planned.

Life is ever-changing. There is no destination to arrive to, only death. There is no question to answer once and for all.
- This is tightly connected with Andrew J. Brown's idea of a fluid life philosophy built on sand.

What people need is a process—a design process—for figuring out what they want, whom they want to grow into, and how to create a life they love.

It’s never too late to design a life you love.

To do
- The best way to write this note is to describe the nature of life first (i.e., no clear goal, cannot be planned)

***

## Designing your life doesn’t involve a clear goal

- Connect here why life doesn't always start with a purpose.

Because life doesn't have a clear goal or destination (or at least not at first), you use the following approach:
- brainstorm
- try "crazy stuff"
- improvise
- build your way forward until you come up with something that works

Designers embrace change. They are not attached to a particular outcome, because they are always focused on what will happen next—not what the final result will be.

## What a well-designed life looks like

A well-designed life has a look and feel all of its own—a beautiful aesthetic that speaks to you.

A well-designed life is a life that is generative—it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. It is not repetitive.

A well-designed life is not a life of drudgery. You weren’t put on this earth to work eight hours a day at a job you hate until the time comes to die.

Problem Finding + Problem Solving = Well-Designed Life

A well-designed life is supported by a healthy body, an engaged mind, and often, though not always, some form of spiritual practice.

***

## Start with empathy

Every design started with a problem.

“Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.”

- Start by empathizing by the person using your life: You.
- Once you have empathize with yourself, brainstorm to create a prototype that you will use to discover what you don't know yet.
- We allow what we discover to pivot, i.e. to reframe our original point of view and modify or change our prototype.

***

## One life can have many designs

There isn’t just one solution to your life. There are many designs for your life, all filled with hope for the kind of creative and unfolding reality that makes life worth living into. Your life is not a thing, it’s an experience; the fun comes from designing and enjoying the experience.

There are many versions of you, and they are all “right.” And life design will help you live into whatever version of you.

Try stuff.

***

## What life design is

Life design is about imagining a life you want, building it, and seeing something that has never existed before emerge.

You have three goals:
1. To conceive of and pursue a life and career you really wanted.
2. To have as few dysfunctional beliefs as possible.
3. To increase your ability to generate new ideas for your life design.

A well-designed life is a life that makes sense. It’s a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. When you have a well-designed life and someone asks you, “How’s it going?,” you have an answer. You can tell that person that your life is going well, and you can tell how and why. A well-designed life is a marvelous portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better, and of achievements and satisfactions. It’s worth emphasizing that failures and hardships are a part of every life, even the well-designed ones.

## Build a team that will support you in your life design

Get a design team. Read the book together. Do the exercises together. Collaborate to support one another in designing your lives.

The different backgrounds in your group assures that you generate truly unique solutions.

***

## Have a bias to action

Before you can do life design, you need to learn to think like a designer.

Designers don’t think their way forward. Designers build their way forward.

you are not just going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world—or the real you. You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuff, and have a lot of fun in the process.

***

## Build the mindsets of a designer

The five mind-sets you are going to learn in order to design your life are curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration. These are your design tools, and with them you can build anything, including a life you love.

- **Curiosity.** Curiosity makes everything new. It invites exploration. It makes everything play. Most of all, curiosity is going to help you “get good at being lucky.” It’s the reason some people see opportunities everywhere.
- **Bias to action.** When you have a bias to action, you are committed to building your way forward. Create prototypes to try things and use the results of those trials to solve or reframe the original problem.
- **Reframing.** Reframing is essential to finding the right problems and the right solutions. Learn to step back, examine your biases, and open new solutions.
- **Awareness.** Learn to let go of the first idea or of a good but not great solution. Learn to see designs from the mess. Let go of the end goal of life and focus on the process—on what is next.
- **Radical collaboration.** Many of the best ideas about how to live your life will come from other people. Know how to ask and identify the right questions to ask.

## Passion comes after mastery

only one in five young people between twelve and twenty-six have a clear vision of where they want to go, what they want to accomplish in life, and why.

80 percent of people of all ages don’t really know what they are passionate about.

Developing a passion takes time. Passion comes after trying something, realizing one wants it, and developing a mastery of it.

Passion is a result of a good life design, not the cause.

***

## There is no one passion that rules them all

Most people do not have that one thing they are passionate about—that singular motivator that drives all of their life decisions and infuses every waking moment with a sense of purpose and meaning.

In truth, most people are passionate about many different things, and the only way to know what they want to do is to prototype some potential lives, try them out, and see what really resonates with them. We are serious about this: you don’t need to know your passion in order to design a life you love. Once you know how to prototype your way forward, you are on the path to discovering the things you truly love, passion or not.

The reframe for the question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is this: “Who or what do you want to grow into?”

## Engaging in life design increases your luck

We can assure you that at times it will take you out of your comfort zone.

What happens when you engage in life design? Actually, something quite extraordinary happens. Things you want start to show up in your life. You start to hear of job openings you were dreaming about. People you were interested in meeting just happen to be in town. What is happening here? For starters, it’s that “getting good at being lucky” thing we mentioned earlier, a result of curiosity and awareness, and a by-product of using the five mind-sets. In addition, the process of discovering who you are and what you want has a rather extraordinary effect on your life. There will be effort and action involved, no doubt, but it will seem, rather surprisingly, as if everyone is conspiring to help you. And, by being aware of the process, you will have a lot of fun along the way.

***

## Start designing your life by taking stock of it

But before you can figure out which direction to head in, you need to know where you are and what design problems you are trying to solve.

That’s why you start where you are. Not where you wish you were. Not where you hope you are. Not where you think you should be. But right where you are.

In order to start where we are, we need to break life down into some discrete areas—health, work, play, and love.

The idea is to pick what to design first, and be curious about how you might design this particular area of your life.

Awareness and curiosity are the design mind-sets you need to begin building your way forward.

You can’t know where you are going until you know where you are.

## Wicked problems

Problems that are resistant to resolution.

***

## Problem finding is as important as problem solving

In design thinking, we put as much emphasis on problem finding as we do on problem solving. After all, what’s the point of working on the wrong problem? We emphasize this because it’s actually not always so easy to understand what our problems are.

Sometimes our problems can feel so overwhelming that we don’t even try to solve them. We just live with them

Our problems become our story, and we can all get stuck in our stories. Deciding which problems to work on may be one of the most important decisions you make, because people can lose years (or a lifetime) working on the wrong problem.

He was so focused on the what-he-had-in-mind problem that he never looked at the real problem

people waste a lot of time working on the wrong problem. If they are lucky, they will fail miserably quickly and get forced by circumstance into working on better problems. If they are unlucky and smart, they’ll succeed—we call it the success disaster—and wake up ten years later wondering how the hell they got to wherever they are, and why they are so unhappy.

How often do we fall in love with our first idea and then refuse to let it go? No matter how badly it turns out. More important, do we really think it is a good idea to let our earnest but misguided seventeen-year-old self determine where we work for the rest of our lives? And what about now? How often do we go with our first idea and think we know answers to questions we’ve never really investigated? How often do we check in with ourselves to see if we are really working on the right problem?

Beware of working on a really good problem that’s not actually the right problem, not actually your problem.

***

## How to find problems

Often we approach our problems as if they are an addition or subtraction problem. We either want to get something (add) or get rid of something (subtract).

Usually, we define our problem by what’s missing, but not always.

Instead of assuming he knew all the answers before he asked the questions, he would have been curious.

***

## Avoid gravity problems

We also tend to get mired in what we call gravity problems.

These are all gravity problems—meaning they are not real problems. Why? Because in life design, if it’s not actionable, it’s not a problem.

It’s a situation, a circumstance, a fact of life. It may be a drag (so to speak), but, like gravity, it’s not a problem that can be solved.

People fight reality. They fight it tooth and nail, with everything they’ve got. And anytime you are arguing or fighting with reality, reality will win.

Remember that the key thing we’re after here is to free you from getting stuck on something that’s not actionable. When you get stuck in a gravity problem, you’re stuck permanently, because there’s nothing you can do, and designers are first and foremost doers.

We recognize that there are two variations of gravity problems—totally inactionable ones (such as gravity itself) and functionally unactionable ones (such as the average income of a full-time poet). Some of you are trying to decide if the thing you’re stuck on is a gravity problem that isn’t actionable, or just a really, really hard problem that will require effort and sacrifice and runs a high risk of failure but is worth trying.

When you accept it, you are free to work around that situation and find something that is actionable.

Even in the face of daunting realities, you always have some freedom you can exercise. Find it and take action there, instead of against gravity.

If you can’t change your life (because of gravity), you can just change your thinking. Or you can decide to take a different route

The key is not to get stuck on something that you have effectively no chance of succeeding at.

If you become open-minded enough to accept reality, you’ll be freed to reframe an actionable problem and design a way to participate in the world on things that matter to you and might even work. That’s all we’re after here—we want to give you the best shot possible at living the life you want, enjoying the living of it, and maybe even making a difference while you’re at it.

The only response to a gravity problem is acceptance. And this is where all good designers begin. This is the “You Are Here” or “Accept” phase of design thinking. Acceptance.

## Health

And by “healthy” we mean being well in mind, body, and spirit—emotional health, physical health, and mental health. The relative importance of each of these aspects of health is up to you. How you measure your own health in these areas is your call. But once you’ve figured out how you define “health,” you need to pay attention to it.

Again, there is no objective perfect balance of these different areas of health, just a subjective personal sense that either “I have enough” or “Something is missing.”

How you rate your health will factor significantly into how you assess the quality of your life and what you might want to redesign going forward.

***
## Work

you won’t be able to understand how to design your work until you understand how it fits into the rest of your life.

By “work” we mean your participation in the great ongoing human adventure on the planet. You may or may not be getting paid for it, but this is the stuff you “do.”

Don’t for a minute reduce work only to that which you get paid for. Most people have more than one form of work at a time.

***
## Play

Play is all about joy.

Play is any activity that brings you joy when you do it. It can certainly include organized activity or competition or productive endeavors, but when those things are done “for the joy of it” they are play. When an activity is done to win, to advance, to achieve—even if it’s “fun” to do so—it’s not play. It may be a wonderful thing, but it’s still not play. The question here is what brings you joy purely in the doing.

Play is about activity that brings joy just for the pure sake of the doing of it. It can include organized activity or productive endeavors, but only if they are done for fun and not merit. We contend that all lives need some play, and that making sure there is some play in our day is a critical life design step. 

***
## Love

Love comes to us in a wide range of types, from affection to community to eroticism, and from a huge array of sources, from parents to friends to colleagues to lovers, but they all share that people thing. That sense of connection. Who are the people in your life, and how is love flowing to and from you and others?

Our primary relationship is where we go first for love, children typically come next, and then it’s a flood of people and pets and community and anything else that is an object of affection. And it is as critical to feel loved by others as it is to love—it has to go both ways.

***
## Use a life dashboard to assess your life before redesigning

Even though perfect balance is not our goal, a look at this diagram can sometimes warn us that something is not right.

Make a quick assessment of your health and then fill in your gauge—are you a quarter full, or half, or three-quarters, or really full?

Make a list of all the ways you “work,” and then “gauge” your working life as a whole.

If you are a regular volunteer in any organization, figure that in, too.

Make a quick list of how you play and then fill in your gauge—are you a quarter full, or half, or three-quarters, or really full?

Where is the love flowing in your life, from you and from others? Make a list, and then fill in your gauge.

Knowing the current status of your health / work / play / love dashboard gives you a framework and some data about yourself, all in one place. Only you know what’s good enough or not good enough—right now.

you may want to come back to this assessment and check the dashboard one more time, to see if anything has changed.

Are you happy right now with where your gauges stand in each of these four areas? Have you looked at them honestly? Are there areas that need action? Have you perhaps come up against one of your wicked problems?

Ask yourself if your problem is actionable. Also, look for some expression of balance and proportionality in your dashboard—very important for design—without imagining that there is some perfect symmetry or balance between all the areas in your life.

***
## Life design is never done

Since life design is an iterative process of prototypes and experimentation, there are lots of on ramps and off ramps along the way. If you’re beginning to think like a designer, you will recognize that life is never done.

We are only done designing our lives when we die. Until then, we’re involved in a constant iteration of the next big thing: life as we know it.

***
## Life design changes your future

As you begin to think like a designer, remember one important thing: it’s impossible to predict the future. And the corollary to that thought is: once you design something, it changes the future that is possible.

Designing something changes the future that is possible.

So, although it is not possible to know your future, or figure out a great life design before you begin, at least you have a good idea of your starting point.
