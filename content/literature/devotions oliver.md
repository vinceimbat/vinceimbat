This is only the second poetry collection book I finished reading. The first collection was the Alon poetry collection _What the Water Said_. Ever since I started writing poems, I also started reading 1-2 poems every morning. I started this poetry reading habit through Mary Oliver's _Devotions_.

_Devotions_ was Mary Oliver's last book. It is a collection of her best poems which she handpicked herself. This collection inspired me to go out in nature more and write poems while there. I also copied the styles of some of her poems in a few poems of mine, like [[inbox/Tumawa ang Bantay]]. The book also made me feel closer to one of the human beings I really admire for just the way she lived. I'm hoping to read a biography of Mary Oliver one day.
