# The editorial process

## Setup
1. Backup original unedited files remotely.
2. Backup original unedited files locally.
3. Make a working copy for the original files.

## Scan
1. Check to see that the files are compatible with your equipment and inspect them.
2. Open each working file and scroll through its contents with all formatting and any markup displayed. Look for obvious technical problems, such as characters or sec­tions in gibberish, which might denote missing fonts or problems with file conver­sion or compatibility; correct any obvious formatting errors, such as midparagraph hard returns.
3. Supply markup for any potentially ambiguous elements, relying on the author's original formatting cues, and to highlight or make note of any conspicuous editorial problems for later attention.
4. Make sure you have all the files for the document; refer to the table of contents, if there is one.
5. Scan for obvious gaps and for any signs (e.g., embedded comments or redlined revisions) that the digital text is not the final version.
6. Confirm that all nontext items­ tables, captions for illustrations, endnotes, and the like-are included.
7. Unless instructed otherwise, remove any embedded tables and graphic elements and sequester them. For book-length manuscripts, these items are usually placed in their own files; for shorter pieces, such as journal articles, they are sometimes placed at the end of the regular text, with section or page breaks inserted between the discrete elements. Some clients prefer to retain embedded tables and graphics.

## Basic Cleanup
1. Inspect the default settings in your word processor's autocorrect and autoformatting features and turn off any that will interfere with file cleanup, such as automatic capitalization or formatting of hyperlinks.
2. Confirm the language setting (e.g., for American or British English) in each file to ensure that a spell-check will use the correct dictionary.
3. Run macro-enabled passes:
	1. changing extra spaces between words and sentences to one space
	2. removing spaces after paragraph breaks
	3. removing extra line spaces between paragraphs
	4. changing underlining to italics
	5. fixing spaces around ellipses
	6. changing straight quotation marks and apostrophes to smart (or curly) quotes
	7. correcting the position of commas and periods in relation to closing quotation marks
	8. removing extra tabs
	9. replacing hyphens between numerals with en dashes (the slightly longer dashes used between numerals in typography)
	10. deleting spaces around em dashes (the typographic equivalent of two typed hyphens signifying an interruption)
4. Run a preliminary spell-check, noting unusual terms for further review during the first read-through and adding recurrent proper names and legitimate unconventional spellings to their word processor's custom dictionary.
5. Perform some initial tagging or styling of various manuscript elements

## Third Pass

Check the following elements:
- Table and figures
- Callouts
- Markups
- Note numbering
- Queries (tact and efficacy)
- Spell check

## Triage When Lacking Time

Prioritize the following if lacking time:
- Spelling, grammar, and punctuation errors
- Factual inconsistencies
- Undefined abbreviations
- Lack of permissions
- Front matter errors (title page, copyright page, TOC)
- Numbering of footnotes, tables, and figures

## Style Sheet

A style sheet should contain the following:
- Special symbols
- Permissions/credits needed
- Tables, figures, and captions
- Dates and numbers
- Miscellaneous notes
- Footnotes
- Bibliography
- Punctuation
- Abbreviations
- Alphabetical list

## Transmittal Letter

1. Brief flattering statement about the manuscript.
2. General instructions for reviewing the revisions
	1. Explain how revisions and queries are displayed on the document.
	2. Explain how to respond to queries, approve changes, add and delete text, and restore text.
	3. Explain the style sheet.
	4. Add warning: Ensure the edited manuscript is correct and final in every respect to avoid major revisions, delays, and costs later.
	5. Specify a deadline.
3. Brief explanation of decisions regarding style and mechanical corrections.
	1. Refer author to expert sources in the event of a disagreement.
4. Mention any pervasive style issues.
	1. Provide one or two examples.
	2. Reference the style sheet and queries.
5. Outline larger concerns and further work. (Spend the most time here.)

## Clean up

1. Backup.
2. Create a working copy.
3. Accept or reject each redlined change.
4. Make changes based on author's query responses.
5. Delete resolved queries.
6. Delete annotations, queries, and redlining marks.
7. Run cleanup macros.
8. Run spell-checker.
