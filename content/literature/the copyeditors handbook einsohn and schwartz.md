According to Schwartz, what is the new expectation for copyediting in the new Wild West of publishing? :: Copyediting now encompasses the full suite of services once provided by an entire team of specialists or the staff of a traditional publishing house.
<!--SR:!2023-10-11,4,270-->

What is the copyeditor's prime directive? :: Remember that words matter.
<!--SR:!2023-10-11,4,270-->

What are the two general-purpose style manuals? :: The Chicago Manual of Style and Words into Type
<!--SR:!2023-10-08,1,230-->

What are the two widely used scientific style manuals? :: Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association and Scientific Style and Format: The CSE Manual
<!--SR:!2023-10-08,1,230-->

What is the best approach when faced with newfangled terms ending in -ize? :: Be suspicious.
<!--SR:!2023-10-11,4,270-->

What is Eisohn's judgement when using the word "folderize"? :: Avoid using it on a general audience since the word is for now the property of techies. However, it fills a semantic need and it will move into general circulation soon.
<!--SR:!2023-10-11,4,270-->

Since copyeditors cannot spend hours researching to arrive at a solution to a problem, what should they do instead? :: Copyeditors should develop judgement about when to leave something alone, when to ask the author to recast, and when to propose a revision. When the problem is not easily solved, they check *several* reference books to identify and weigh conflicting opinions, and to make an informed decision about when to apply, adapt, or ignore various conventions and rules.
