# Idioms

Stars raining down on the rice fields
Making limp the uncut grass
The peninsula begins to eat itself in spring

# Insights

- Is there a historical thread that perhaps binds me with Los Baños? Executed correctly, it could tie perfectly with my being here.
- The writing should combine: the act of walking past space, meaning-making of each point of space, reflection on decay and change, tying together current stories with history
- The walk just simply resists narrativity. You have no choice but to jump from one memory to another.
- These blocks of text are like scenes in a movie. This is why watching a movie can only improve your writing.
- Again: what is in the landscape? How does it connect with your inner life? How does it connect with the bigger story of people there?
- Try to use poetry by combining images together or putting them alongside each other or in one section
- A formula: describe what you see in the walk, go specific to one person or place, find a story there, then wrap it up with a witty, poetic conclusion that could tie everything together
- Photo: very minimalist colors, low exposure
- The drinking scene affected me (see diary entry for [[2023-12-17]]). CM skips time, goes to the past by returning to the present via the gravity of the walking act. While he walks, objects in the landscape triggers his knowledge about the history of the place, his personal history, meditations on walking, and stories of people he meets in the walk.
