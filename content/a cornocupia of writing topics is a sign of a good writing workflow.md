You can notice this cornucopia of writing topics in two levels:

1. The [[writing inbox]] is filled with [[fleeting notes]] that need to be processed into [[evergreens]], and
2. The [[zettelkasten]] or [[talahardin]] itself is filled with clusters of notes that you can turn into a piece of writing.

When you [[use a note-writing system]] with a note-writing practice, the problem of what to write about is eliminated. You simply need to [[Look inside the Talahardin for a topic]] and you will realized you have a lot of it. The reason for this is because, the question "What will I write about?" has been answered every single day you do your note-writing routine ([[my note-writing practice]]). And you perform that routine following your interests because you [[use curiosity to guide your thinking]]. [[a note-writing system makes writing easier]].
