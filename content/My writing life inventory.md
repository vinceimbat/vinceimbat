## Writing

**How long have you been writing regularly?**

I starte writing regularly since I starte my journaling practice around 2018. So that's about four years already.

**How much do you write each week?**

Now, I write at least two page on my journal daily. I take notes while outdoors. I also write notes on my [[talahardin]]. I published a 500–1,000-word essay every two weeks and another 1,000-word essay every month. I write probably 7,000–10,000 words per week.

**Is your schedule structured or sporadic?**

Structured. The only exception to my schedule is when I work during the last five days of the month or when I travel.

**Are you focusing on one project or experimenting with various ideas?**

Right now, I am experimenting with multiple ideas. I am feeling myself among writing practical philosophy, nature writing, place-based writing, and walking narratives. Most recently, I am attracted to the idea of writing my own style of romantic excursions in the tradition of Thoreau. I want to incorporate philosophy into writing narratives. I have several ideas for book projects (e.g., one book for each of the places I lived in: San Jacinto, Baguio, Los Baños). But I haven't committed on one yet.

## Reading

**Do you read regularly? How many books per year?**

Yes. Last year, was my slowest year in terms of reading, because I spent more time reading articles. However, since 2015, I average 10 books a year.

**What are your three favorite topics or genres?**

I like reading creative nonfiction books that illuminate something about the world (philosophical)
, tells the story of a person worth emulating (biographical), and is situated in a specific time and space (historical and geographical).

**What are the last five books you read?**

1. Kissa by Kissa by Craig Mod
2. DIY MFA by Gabriela Pereira
3. Transcend by Scott Barry Kaufmann
4. A Philosophy of Walking by Frederic Gros
5. Be the Gateway by Dan Blankaz

## Community

**Do you have writer friends or colleagues?**

Yes. Rem, Claire, Lea, Bevs, CR, Rom, etc. But these are more of friends than colleagues, and not everyone is a serious writer like me.

**Do you have a critique group where you can exchange feedback?**

None.

**Have you gone to any events or conferences?**

Only once: Saling Panitik 2019.

**Do you read any writing blogs, magazines, or websites?**

Not really on writing per se. I only read blogs and websites of writers I admire.

**Do you connect with writers on social media? If so, where?**

I don't deliberately interact with them. But I follow them on IG and Twitter. My writer friends are, of course, in Facebook.

**What is the biggest "win" you've experienced in your writing, reading, or community building this past year?**

I was able to increase the writing I do through the Talahardin, which I then used to complete two seasons of Lilim.

**If you could improve one thing in your writing life, what would that be?**

Build my writing community.
