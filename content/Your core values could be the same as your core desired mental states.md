What do we mean when we say [[thoughts/value]]? Is value physical or conceptual? Does it have a different metaphysical status?

When I say, I value my phone, there seems to be several things being referred to here:

- The phone, a physical object.
- Me, the value-giver.
- The value, a conceptual thing I attach to a physical object.

[[Values are conceptual]] because they require minds to exist. Without a value-giver, there would be no value. Value works like meaning.

Are values mental states? I think so. They exist in the mind.

So when I say I value my phone, I may call my phone my value but actually I am referring to the concept in my mind: The phone is important to me.

Mental states could replace the phone. If I say, I value happiness, I may seem to refer to the mental state that I experienced, but the value is a concept in my mind: Happiness is important to me.

Therefore, a [[core desired mental state]] could be a core desired value as well.

Also, since values are conceptual, [[A single area or project could satisfy all your values]].

Could values be relationships?
