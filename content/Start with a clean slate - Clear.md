Imagine all your responsibilities and obligations vanish overnight.

What would you miss doing? What would you choose to add back to your life?

If you're searching for more time this year, start with a clean slate and choose what to add to your days rather than starting with a full schedule and trying to figure out what to eliminate.

~ James Clear
