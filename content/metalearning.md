Metalearning means learning about learning. We perform metalearning to create a personalized plan for a [[self-directed learning]] project ([[ultralearning]]). Metalearning prevents us from getting lost or choosing a learning path unwisely. The more we practice meta-learning, the better we do it in subsequent projects (i.e., in gathering resources, time management, managing motivation, and building confidence).
