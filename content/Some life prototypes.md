Some of the objectives I try to satisfy through my [[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]] on [[thoughts/living]] are the following:

- Learning through [[Self-directed learning]]
- Designing a ground-level productivity system
- Reconnecting with one’s [[thoughts/true self]]
- Designing a system that aligns one’s actions with one’s true self
- Building a [[Personal knowledge management]] system
- Using systems and methods to accomplish basic well-being goals
- Creating a personal philosophy of living
- Creating a life manual
