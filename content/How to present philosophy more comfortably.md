Philosophy is often written in a way that is difficult. There are ways in [[How to do maginhawa philosophizing]], but are there ways to present the products of philosophizing in a way that is easier for others to consume? Here are some ideas on how to do that:

1. Use fiction to present philosophical ideas.
2. Use the autobiographical voice. My idea here is to narrate how I discovered certain truths or insights. A weekly update on this journey via a newsletter captures the process (see also [[Philosophical autobiography]]).
3. Use photography.
