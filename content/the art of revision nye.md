"Each thing gives us something else."

Revision is the most refreshing part of writing.

Poetry as a slow art.
Revision as the slowest part of it.

ABC of composition by Roberto Bonazzi
- attention
- being
- cutting

You can then add.
- tweezering words in and out

Have a regular practice.

Write drafts luxuriously.
Then leave a space after initial writing.

Continuing to revise after publication is a positive endeavor.

Make revision the pleasure-dome of writing.

William Stafford: "Revision is when you started hearing the paper speaking back."

You Must Revise Your Life (book)
