The Sandugo: Kampuhan sa Diliman 2016 Literary Folio was created as a tribute to the lakbayan (caravan) of more than 3,000 Moros and Indigenous Peoples from all over the Philippines to Metro Manila that made camp at the University of the Philippines Diliman from Oct. 12 to 27, 2016.

The poems are not collage-like but include them in the relationship of walking and writing.

"Ang Pagbawi" could be a good example of the raw, unfinished draft as literature.
- The organizers of the folio published the work with uncorrected grammar and spelling.
- The rawness of a work, which makes it closer to the draft, doesn't just have aesthetic implications. It has political implications.
- If this is how a marginalized community writes and tries hard to write despite in this raw form, does ascribing completeness into their work as editors and compilers of folios replicate the violence and censorship they've faced in real life into the page?
