I sought to explain my experience while walking. Why did all of a sudden I question my motivation for something I have been doing for a long time.

Walking as a means of traversing liminality

Used walking to explore this liminality between ethnographer and the studied, I contend that walking can also be used by an autoethnographer to traverse liminal terrains between old an new identities and especially so when one finds onself uprooted from place.

Walking helped me get a better grasp of insights about myself and my environment in a way I would've missed otherwise.

the uses of walking
- embodied learning
- identity reconstruction
- reconnecting to place
- challenging multiple disabilities
