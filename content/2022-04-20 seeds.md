Kalachuchi at UCCP CSI blooming

Yellow fir tree too

Fruit like sineguelas falls down trees behind library

Small bird (the one with the yellow crest) was singing when I passed by. Then took a shit.

A tiny house with a tiny dog and a tiny staircase

Rules for a grounding walk

- Photography (must see objects or scenes that i can examine in different angles)
