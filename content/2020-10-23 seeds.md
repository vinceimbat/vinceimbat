Sky reading

- North: low cumulus with some gray outgrowth. Altostratus behind.
- East: half of cordi covered in low cumulonimbus. Stratus fills the rest.
- South: stratus really dark and some large cumulonimbus too
- West: clearer than the South but same clouds
- Overhead: cumulonimbus. The moon was showing for a while until it wasn't.
- Strong wind

The bat flies like a butterfly. Their wings move the same way.

Moon about 1/3 light. Soon it will be a half moon.
