The ground level of the life management system accomplishes two things:

1. It **captures** loose ends (notes, tasks, events, reading materials, and other inputs).
2. It **organizes** the clarified loose ends (note: clarification happens during [[Review]]) using a [[Personal knowledge management]] system (which, if digital, should be backed up using a backup system).

The tools needed for this level are:

- A note-taking container (app, analog, or a combination)
- A task manager
- A calendar
- A read-later container
- Other digital and analog inboxes (email, desktop, downloads, etc.)
- A projects list
- An areas list
- A resources folder
- An archive folder
- A backup system

To do
- create a note on how to create a back up system
