There are three kinds of literary excursions that [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau]] used:
- ramble ("Walking")
- trip (Cape Cod)
- sojourn (Walden)

In a [[literary excursion]], Thoreau narrates a spiritual quest as it proceeds. The latter half of his journals had a similar form.

The excursion does not feel obligated to be detailed in its description of a specific setting. Instead, it spends most of its time providing an account of the universe as a whole from the perspective of the author.

Thoreau's choice of this form may in part be due to the fact that it was a popular form in his time. Thoreau has read over 146 travel books.

Travel literature could still be instructive while still being delightful. It was more literary than factual.

Among all of the travel books he read, William Gilpin's *Remarks of Forest Scenery and Other Woodland Views* was perhaps closest to Thoreau's taste.
