Ang dula napakahalagang sumunod sa classic structure.
Dahil immediate ang interaksyon ng audience sa play.
Play is the most effective way to change things (because its impact is immediate).

drama = dran (meaning "to do or to act")

A play needs to have action. Shouldn't just be talking.

Characters must undergo change.
- dynamic character.
- not everyone in the play should change; just one (the main character) at least

Story = process of discovery and decision, connection and disconnection

Read Oedipus Rex
- hubris tragic flaw (pride)
- every tragic hero has a hubri which leads to the tragedy

Pivotal character must discover something then change.

Contemporary definition of drama
- If you say that someone dramatizes a situaton or event, you mean that they try to make it seem more serious, more important, more exciting than it really is.
- intensified and condensed experience (mas nakikita ang talento kapag mas condensed ang drama)
- 1 page of double spaced is 2 minutes

the best playwrights are actors, producers, and directors

dramatic action means a dramatic question is raised and answered by the end of the play (Egri)
- pag-upo mo palang dapat alam mo na kung ano ang tanong ng play

Premise: a proposition stated or assumed as leading to a conclusion; must be proved by the play

play questions shouldn't be difficult to answer: just yes or no

The dramatic question of Romeo & Juliet is:
c. Will their families reconcile because of their love?

If the question is answered before the play ended, that is not the dramatic question?

Everything in a play is SET UP or framed: the importance of structure

Art and artifice (DESIGN)
- Unity of opposites: a conflict between two opposing characters in which compromise is impossible; they are united to destroy each other

PLOT (Freytag's Triangle, Revisited)
1. Inciting incident - Something has already happened before the curtains opened, which is suggested at the oppening scene
2. Point of attack - sets up conflict
3. Climax - highest point/discovery
4. Turning point - decision
5. Ending - what happens now? what is the answer to the dramatic question?

Understand what is conventional before you break it.

Contemporary short stories no longer follow traditional short story format.

One-act play
- 15-45 minutes
- Can be 1 or 3 or 5 scenes: Unity of action
- 7 scenes?
- One set: unity of time and prlace.
- Or two: divide state; use elevation use proscenium

Ideally isa lang ang setting.

Hindi ideal ang flashback sa play. (flashback is a cheap trick and it slows down the story)

One-act play 7 scenes is too much.

Character

Who a person is: EXTERNALIZED.

Prepare a character sketch of traits:
- physical
- social
- psychological a (to a childhood secret?)
- a metaphor that embodies character
- idiolect

Wag masyadong detailed ang ilagay na traits ng character. Hayaan mong ang director at actor na bigyang buhay ang character. Unless crucial sa action ang trait.

Dapat may sariling idiolect ang bawat character (i.e., sariling paggamit ng expressions)

Thoughts are externalized (through behavior and dialogue)

Dialogue can be used to move an action forward, reveal character, or hide character.

Pivotal Character:
"Make your characters want something right away, even if it's only a glass of water." - Kurt Vonnegut

Get your want writing exercise (how do characters dialogue when they are trying to get what they want).

Something is at stake. Something matters. A lot.

He or she must want it badly he or she will destroy or be destroyed to have it.

Dialogue
- embodies character
- provides background
- moves the plot forward
- has tension: something is going to happen; something is stirring inside
- subtext: what is meant but not said (hides)

Wag magtapon ng linya. Every line must have something stirring.

The elements of drama are also found in fiction,

SPECTACLE

- set design
- props, costumes, make-up
- light and sound design
- requires collaboration between text and stage; writer and director and production staff

"If you put a gun on stage, it has to fire." Checkhov

When you are writing a play, it has to be collaborative.

Watch plays

WRITING TITLES:

1. Description of what the plays is about

"The Persecution and Assassination of Jean Paul Marat Portrayed by the Acting Company of the Asylum at Charenton Under the Director of Mr. de Sade"

-> Quills (film)

2. Metaphoric: generates excitement, symolism, double meanings, general cleverness; suggests the play's theme

M. Butterfly
Night, Mother

Sample format: Dagmay.online

Stage directions are italicized.

Bold the names of speakers.

Don't put emotional directions. Asahan nalang ang mga artista.

***

The ultimate test is when a play is finally staged. A play is continually re-written and revised collaboratively by the whole production team and the audience.

(It's not for self-centered folks!)

Do you agree?

"I don't write, I listen, and I just take dictation. I only hear people talking and I put down what they say." - Michael Weller

There has to be artifice.

Gaano kahaba ang dialogue?
- dapat may rhythm din
- depende sa pacing

Dapat 2 minutes palang nasabi mo na dapat ang conflict.
