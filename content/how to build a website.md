Here are steps you can take in designing your website:

1. Do a survey of ten colleagues to see what their sites look like.
2. Design a website that is simple in both content and design.
3. List the core things your website needs to do then include only those.
4. Include as few items on the navigation bar as possible.
5. Write in the first person.
6. Be clear about what the main gateway represents, and why they would want to enter.
7. Consider whether you will create long-form content.

The key thing to remember when designing is to keep it simple so you are focusing your audience's attention and not splitting it.
