If you are looking for that feeling, you will always be in vain.

If marrying is something you do want for yourself, then accept the fact

- That you will never feel the feeling of loving someone more than yourself because you can never truly love something you can't see firsthand.
- What you could love is the projection of personhood you perceive from the other person

If staying into something forever is really what you are looking for then

- Find someone who gives you the biggest chance for you to stay in love with her through the years
