One of the best experiences I have when [[walking]] is when I cover the same place I've walked either through walking or driving past it and seeing the stark contrast between the two experiences. I noticed this with my long walk to San Pablo vs my jeep ride back home and my evening walks during the cancellation of inperson classes and my evening walks now that the classes have returned in UPLB. [[Rewalking the same space opens the possibility of closeness with it]].
