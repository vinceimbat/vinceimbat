Steps

1. Pick a topic.
2. Write down five or six things related to that idea. Write down the first words that come to mind. Draw three to four lines from each word. Free-associate new words related to these prompts. Aim for three to four rings.
3. Highlight a few things that might be interesting (or jump out at you). Mash them together into a few concepts. Pick from the outer layer of the perimeter.
