You can generate a desired mental state by:

1. using your will, psychological abilities, and body to generate good feelings, or
2. curate your environment to make it easier for you to generate the mental state.

We favor the latter over the former ([[People usually think that modifying their environment is their ultimate purpose]]). However, it is completely possibile to cultivate a mental state without requirinng external forces or objects. My mental states, which were created by mental practices, influence my body that produces my dream state. I still interact with my body. But I don't need instruments to achieve a mental state. I can do it instantaneously, as in a shorter time frame.

1. volitional instinct
2. act
3. desired mental state
