![Sky, now, and ground](sky-now-ground.jpeg)

You have multiple [[project]]s and multiple [[action]]s under those projects. The consolidation of these projects and actions could lead you towards your [[purpose]] ([[my purpose statement]]).

However, there is only this moment. [[you can only be at one state at any given moment]] The most critical decision of all is what you do at this moment—this action.

Because [[there is a single list of values]], this use of [[free will]] signifies what you prioritize at this moment. What you do now is a vote to the short life you want to live.

Once a choice has been made, the next critical step is to [[Make peace with your choice]] and let go of what you didn’t choose to do. This is only possible if you [[make sure that what you choose to do is indeed what you need to do]].
