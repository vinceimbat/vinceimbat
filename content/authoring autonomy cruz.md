>As final exhibits of what the poet deemed necessary to relinquish when he came of age as an activist on the streets of Manila, ―The Annotated Catechism‖ and ―Prometheus Unbound throw into crisis the seeming autonomy of English-language poetry by Filipinos, as well as the nativist nationalism that forecloses the possibility of an empowering literary appropriation of the colonial tongue. Arguably excursions in psychogeography undertaken by the postcolonial poet as aspiring flaneur, the poems are pressured to confront the public space in which they seem to have no place. English is used to write the experience of walking in and around Manila, an act that itself is a form of public speech, exercised during the fiery marches of the First Quarter Storm, and later, silenced by the curfew and surveillance of martial law.

(p. 119)
>The third is a fragmented meditation that seems to spring from the experience of walking the streets of Manila.

To do
- Read Chapter 3 until end
- Look for a copy of Jose Lacaba's The Annotated Catechism

>This study examines the autonomy of art as a governing principle in the artistic practice of Filipino poets in English. The Western modernist ideal of art for art‘s sake was transplanted to the Philippines via the educational system implemented during the American occupation in the early twentieth century. As appropriated in colonial Philippines, what is historically regarded as a form of artistic resistance to the capitalist and rapidly industrializing society of the West is traditionally read as a withdrawal of participation by colonial and postcolonial literary writers from the political realm. The writer who subscribes to art for art‘s sake supposedly fetishizes form _in itself_ and simply has no stake in lived realities and no role in the production of a national literature. _Authoring Autonomy_ interrogates the division between aesthetics and politics that occurs when the autonomy of art is presumed to be incompatible with the work of social transformation. It accounts for the potential and limits of autonomy as a form of critical intervention
