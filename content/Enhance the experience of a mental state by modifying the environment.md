Modifying one's environment is one of some [[Actions to take to experience an emotion intentionally]]. In my case, it could involve modifying my immediate environment as well as the bigger environment where I am located (geographical and sociopolitical location). People are part of that environment, so influencing them to change their behavior in a way that enhances my personal experience of a [[Mental state]] like [[Ginhawa]] is part of this process.

[[People usually think that modifying their environment is their ultimate purpose]] But the truth is that [[What we ultimately want is to be in a particular mental state]]. Therefore, even if [[A purpose is not always the same as a core desired mental state]], [[It is better to align purpose with a core desired mental state]].

While modifying one’s environment is only secondary to experiencing a core desired mental state directly, it is nevertheless still important, as context has a profound effect on our mental states. In my case, pursuing Ginhawa means embracing a goal [[To help create a world filled with Ginhawa]].

Other ways of modifying one’s environment to experience or enhance a mental state are:

- Managing information influx and management
- Life management
- Curating physical space

To do
- Too long for a permanent note
