# Approach

You might be stronger now, but you still need to consider how to take care of yourself on these walks. Some memories that are actually untrue could be even more triggering than true memories. Consider how to take care of yourself while doing these walks.

To protect yourself, treat the walk primarily as a meditation of place, not as a way to reminisce. Use the present moment as an anchor. When memories arise, treat them like thoughts during meditation. Step back and be a witness to them.

You can also use place-making by coming up with questions you can ask yourself when you are there.

# Rules

1. Do the walks within seven days.
2. Perform a minimum of four and a maximum of six walks.
3. Use the present moment as an anchor to the walks.
4. Treat memories that come as clouds of thoughts during meditation.
5. Use the camera only when called.
6. Photograph streets, not specific houses of people I know from the church.
7. Write short notes when necessary but flesh them out only after the walks.
8. When writing about people, change their names.
9. Report about the number of steps taken.
10. A single map will be shared at the end of the walks.
