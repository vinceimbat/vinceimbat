2023 will come down as the year of archetypes. I met many archetypes this year: a couple of archetypes for the spiritual life I am designing for myself, at least one archetype for photography, and many more archetypes for writing. These are people I'm privileged and honored to have met this year and know personally. Meeting them accelerated my growth in areas I care about in ways I've previously unable to imagine that I'm now convinced the quality of my life could only be proportionate with the amount of time I spend with these people. Back home, I grew up with almost no archetype on the kind artistic, adventurous, spiritual life I now want to live. To meet these people in my 30s is nothing short of undeserved grace.
