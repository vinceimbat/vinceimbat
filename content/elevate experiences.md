I want my creation process and products to elevate my experiences. Since two of my most important strengths are [[appreciation of beauty and excellence]] and [[continued freshness of appreciation]], I believe that my work is to appreciate life and the universe. I want to focus on the eternities. I want to be near nature and beauty as much as possible and highlight them. I want to curate what I tell the world on just these things. I want to document a life about these things and share that to others. (See diary entry from [[2023-01-18]].)
