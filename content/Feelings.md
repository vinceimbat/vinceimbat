A feeling is a [[Mental state]] that requires two things:
- It has to be experienced consciously.
- It has to have a bodily or somatic dimension.

All [[Emotional experiences]] are feelings because they are conscious. On the other hand [[Emotions]] can only be felt through the emotional experiences they create. Unlike feelings, they are not always conscious, and some can be hidden for a long time.

I think that one's metaphysical and epistemological stance could change how one sees the difference between the two. See [[thoughts/dualism]].

>An emotional experience, by virtue of being a conscious experience, is necessarily a feeling, as are physical sensations such as hunger or pain (although not all conscious experiences are also feelings, not, for example, believing or seeing, presumably because they lack a somatic or bodily dimension).
