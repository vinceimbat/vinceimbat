==Question: How can I incorporate "ministry"?

Reasons why I want to incorporate
- When I was a JW minister, my dream was to be a missionary, which involved working directly with people and seeing the effect of my work tangibly.
- However, after my depression and leaving the JWs, I noticed I became more invested in more solitary activities like writing, studying, and photography. These helped in my healing.
- But I am now feeling an itch to get out there and doing something that is more direct.
	- I am contemplating returning to sign language and working with the Deaf again. ==(NOT NOW.)==
	- I am even asking myself whether I should be a "minister" but I'm unsure what that looks like in a free-religion sense. ==(NO.)==
	- I am even asking whether or not I could treat what I'm currently doing (writing and photography) as the ministry itself. But how to make them less solitary. ==(YES. EXPLORE THIS.)==

# Ministry in Jiyu Shukyo

How might I able to experience "ministering" to others directly in a free, creative spirituality?

Universalists had more missionary tendency. But not unitarian tradition.

No evangelism.

Missionary quality of kiitsu kyokai
- meditate without doctrinal theories
- free conversation (with gravity)
- create spaces of freedom

Ministry
- Imaoka failed in Japan because he didn't know how to do free-religion ministry.
	- He had bad experience in the church.
	- He don't want rituals.
	- Went down the minimalist route.
		- Creed of life weekly recital.
	- Japanese devotion culture so people didn't speak freely.
	- No buildings.
	- Imaoka failed in pedia.
- He became an educator.
 
Kiitsu kyokai may not need a minister like it is in the tradition in Unitarian.
- We become ministers to each other.
- Ministry is spread out.
- Create a structure then teach people how to do it.
	- Balangay: keel of a ship needed for it to be centered.
		- The creed is the keel.
 
Ministry is teaching others and transferring structure or teachings so they can stand even if you're gone.

If you don't have a ministry.

What will be the institutional structures of kiitsu kyokai?

Ministry
- How can you be a minister without being in charge.
