- [[Building a body or building a bridge - Clear]]

"In some areas of life, value is unlocked by starting. Even a five-minute workout or a short walk can reset your mood and benefit your body.

In other areas, value is unlocked by finishing. It does you no good to build a bridge halfway across the river. You need to complete the project to realize the value.

Do you need to start or finish? Are you building a body or building a bridge?"

â€“ James Clear

We often say that writing cannot replace speech and leaves out a lot of elements, but I would argue that this depends. For some people like me, we express ourselves better through the written word and because expressing ourselves is a slow process we are able to make sure that we have said what we want to say in a less pressured context
