# What is the jiyū shūkyō approach to studying my jiyū shūkyō?

Since creating my jiyū shūkyō will be a long and winding process, it's unwise to treat it like a [[project]]. It's best maintained or supervised as a [[life area]]. Success in this endeavor isn't measured by finishing or reaching an end point but by maintaining a certain standard. In this case, my standard for my jiyū shūkyō could be something like a portion of [[my mission statement]]: "I'm engaged every day in a pursuit of wisdom, meaning, and beauty."

Specifically, success in my jiyū shūkyō area includes the following:
- maintenance of contemplative practices like [[seiza]] and [[walking]]
- maintenance of mindful [[reading]], [[journaling]], and studying through my [[talahardin]]
- maintenance of practices through communities and others
- maintenance of creative practices involving walking, [[writing]], and [[photography]]

These all involve maintaining [[habits]], [[routines]], and [[review|reviews]].

But how do I study in a way that makes me feel that I'm not constricted, that I'm allowed to flow and follow my curiosities, while maintaining a measure of focus?

In the creation of my jiyū shūkyō, I need to let go of this desire for blueprints. Spirituality and answers to how to live are best left unblueprinted. I should have faith that this process will result to something. As long as I follow my curiosities and authenticity, I will eventually focus.

Some ideas on how to study:

1. Use [[my purpose statement]], [[my vision statement]], and [[my mission statement]] to be selective in what I read.
2. I should implement a [[menu]].
3. I could categorize the subjects of my studies into bigger fields of inquiry.


My [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]] (自由宗教) consists of the following fields of inquiry:
- [[western liberal religion]]
- [[eastern liberal religion]]
- [[filipino spirituality]]
- creative expressions such as [[walking]], [[writing]], and [[photography]]
