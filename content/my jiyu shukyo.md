# What is the jiyū shūkyō approach to studying my jiyū shūkyō?

Since creating my jiyū shūkyō will be a long and winding process, it's unwise to treat it like a [[project]]. It's best maintained or supervised as a [[life area]]. Success in this endeavor isn't measured by finishing or reaching an end point but by maintaining a certain standard. In this case, my standard for my jiyū shūkyō could be something like a portion of [[my mission statement]]: "I'm engaged every day in a pursuit of wisdom, meaning, and beauty."

Specifically, success in my jiyū shūkyō area includes the following:
- maintenance of contemplative practices like [[seiza]] and [[walking]]
- maintenance of mindful [[reading]], [[journaling]], and studying through my [[talahardin]]
- maintenance of practices through communities and others
- maintenance of creative practices involving walking, [[writing]], and [[photography]]

These all involve maintaining [[habits]], [[routines]], and [[review|reviews]].

But how do I study in a way that makes me feel that I'm not constricted, that I'm allowed to flow and follow my curiosities, while maintaining a measure of focus?

In the creation of my jiyū shūkyō, I need to let go of this desire for blueprints. Spirituality and answers to how to live are best left unblueprinted. I should have faith that this process will result to something. As long as I follow my curiosities and authenticity, I will eventually focus.

Some ideas on how to study:

1. Use [[my purpose statement]], [[my vision statement]], and [[my mission statement]] to be selective in what I read.
2. I should implement a [[menu]].
3. I could categorize the subjects of my studies into bigger fields of inquiry.


My [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]] (自由宗教) consists of the following fields of inquiry:
- [[western liberal religion]]
- [[eastern liberal religion]]
- [[filipino spirituality]]
- creative expressions such as [[walking]], [[writing]], and [[photography]]

# Unprocessed

Let my curiosities dictate each day's study. Trust in this long process. The talahardin is the intermediate packet. As long as you follow your curiosities, something will eventually happen.

Let go of this need to be efficient in your studies.

As long as you are being selective of what you read and letting go of diving into subject matter that will distract you (FOCUS AND AUTHENTICITY applied in my everyday studies), you'll be good.

The documentation of the spiritual journey is the key. And that is why Thoreau journaled. But how did he arranged these together? And when did he knew he can start arranging?

It is one thing to say you want to reintegrate and another to really practice faith. You have to practice faith even in your work. Faith that the words will come at the right time. That words will come despite the meanderings.
