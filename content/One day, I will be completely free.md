One day, I will be completely free from the need to make money in the market economy.

One day, I will have my own piece of land - farm it, bring people to help me, build a community, raise kids there, help heal the world through building a life that is kind to it.

One day, my life will be completely connected with the rest of Nature, even if I do not see the fruition of a changed society, knowing I did my best and believed will be enough.

One day I will be healed naturally.

One day I will be surrounded by good people.

One day, every day will be a day of peace, and when that peace is disrupted, I am able to hold the tension better.
