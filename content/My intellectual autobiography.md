My intellectual history can be divided into four periods:

1. [[The JW period of my intellectual life]]
2. [[The humanist period of my intellectual life (2011-2014)]]
3. [[The Eastern philosophy period of my intellectual life (2015â€“2017)]]
4. [[The rational period of my intellectual life (2017-]]

If I am going to turn my life into a book, these would be helpful:

- [[One-sentence summary of my intellectual autobiography]]
- [[One-paragraph outline of my intellectual autobiography]]
- [[One-paragraph summary of my intellectual autobiography]]
- [[Outline of my intellectual autobiography]]
