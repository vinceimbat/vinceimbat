There are two things you can do to focus while working, e.g. while writing.

1. [[break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]]. If they are small, they can be accomplished in one go, which is that focusing on them does not require a lot of willpower.
2. [[Close open loops by externalizing them]]. In [[philosophy]], externalize the product of your thinking by writing down the outcomes via [[evergreens]]. You can also write possible connections between notes and reminders for open questions and tasks you’ll do later. [[andy matuschak]] leaves reminders like these in individual permanent notes. Another way to do this is to use a [[writing inbox]] where [[fleeting notes]] about undeveloped ideas are stored. As long as they are there, they serve as reminders for these [[open loops]] without distracting us.
