- [[essays/a walk to maahas road]]
- [[Being in a place is better than reading about it]]

No place stays the same. Like the rest of the world, a place changes constantly every second. It is always a new place. But that newness will be unnoticed without close attention.

Andaming liku-liko sa daang ito. Pagawaan ng kotse. Bilihan ng segundamanong kotse. Walang sidewalks. Nice to see a wood yard. Two groups of children playing in their inflatable pools.

Talagang kailangan ko ng ganitong mga moments. Araw-araw. May napakalaking balakid sa pagsusulat ko kapag wala ang mga ganitong lugar at pagkakataon. Kailangan kong subukang bumalik sa dating kalagayan. At hindi na ulit magsusulat para maghanap-buhay.

Ang pinakatawag sa akin ay ang manatili sa ganitong mga pagkakataon hanggat kaya ko. Ang makinig at magmasid at magantay na mamamangha.

For sure, reading about a history of the place is helpful. Will get you to see a particular spot differently. But to really get to know a place, nothing beats getting there, touching it with your feet, walking it, touching it with your hands, and looking at it as close as you can. Without walking a place, you cannot befriend it.

How to commune with a picture.

I am filled with joy when I come from nature. Society makes me sick.
