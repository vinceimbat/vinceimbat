Celia presented an introduction to sand trays.

I told Celia that sand trays are completely new to me. I shared my scant experiences with art therapy. I told them that this breaks my default mode of being. Her talk brought out thoughts on articulation and choice and how some of the choices or opportunities that came in my life came not through rationalization but by emotion. Some things jump into us rather than thought.

Andrew related to what I said about sand trays breaking my default state of being. He said he was a child of the enlightenment. But he was interested on how sand trays could be tied with jiyu shukyo and liberal religion. For example, his "thought of the day" is a liturgical sand tray, and because of this, it is jiyu shukyo. It is syncretic. Andrew mentions Buridan's ass and how liberal religion is like it: it wants to constantly defer decisions.

Andrew then raised the subject of our relationship with matter. He mentioned Vibrant Matter by Jane Benett, a member of the new materialists, who argue that matter is not inert stuff, but that it is active and illicit meaning.

Celia asks the question of how far interacting with matter goes in human evolution. She mentions a book she is currently reading called *Other Minds*, and mentions that granite does not contemplate itself but that it still is interacting.

Andrew mentions a book he read years ago, which is related to the topic: *Radical Spinoza*.

I told them that the discussion is making me think about the place of objects and matter in a spirituality. I asked why it took a while for Imaoka to include "nature" into his principles.

Andrew told me I was wrong for saying that nature wasn't included in the first version of the principles because for Imaoka, everything was nature, and that man and society is nature. But Andrew agreed that there is a puzzle to this because Imaoka rejected the supernaturalism of Shinto and avoided any material representation of what is being worshipped. But at the end of his life he made a turn.

Andrew mentions the Indian Unitarian tradition, specifically Brahma Saraj, which also stripped itself of symbols but later evolved to embrace imagery.

Celia went on to share specific experiences on working with the sand tray years ago, which she still remembers until now.

The session ended by me saying that I am keen on trying the sand tray but asked how I might start doing it by myself.

comment on:

words as symbols
