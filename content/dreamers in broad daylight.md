The title sets the stage for the rest of the essay.
The title informs the use of a subheading immediately right after it.

The first subheading uses a kind of daydreaming but it also introduces the subject of the essay.

At end of the first subheading, she returned to the subject of daydreaming itself, not necessarily for insights but for questions: returning to the subject matter.

The essay moves chronologically too. Narrates stories from the author's experiences after her divorce.

At each subheading, there is always the story, but also, there is always a processing of the story.

IV: DIFFERENCE

Here the author uses data from her interviews and readings to demonstrate that daydreams are different among each person

And again, stories for example then synthesis.

V: PLAY

Describes her child's play.
Sigmund Freud's theory on child's play.
Winnicot's theory on the connection between imagination and play.
Synthesis: a taxonomy of daydreaming

VI: CREATION

Freud's thesis that the creative writer is a professional daydreamer.

Womanhouse (examples from research and history)

So always an example and a synthesis.

Daydreaming as anticapitalist.

More examples.

Negative daydreams

Her own daydream

VII: NET

Anecdote from her life again

Insight

Interview

Instagram discussion

Illustration using an IG account

Daydreaming in the internet age

Tiktok

POV videos

She also uses questions sometimes instead of direct insights

VIII: ESCAPE

Anecdote from a friend's life

Her own insights

IX: COMPULSION

Anecdote from history

Introducing a concept from the literature

More examples

X: DEATH

Anecdote from her own life

Meditations about the end

INSIGHTS TO BE USED ON THE PANG WALKING ESSAY

I have to meditate on each form of walking and how it informs how I want to walk Pangasinan.

Use the different kinds of walks as meditations to the walking you plan on doing NOW.

Remember, the goal of this essay is to preface the next walks in Pangasinan.

The themes of the walks
1. Tayacdang - the next walks are a way of relearning but also forgetting what I used to know about Pangasinan.
2. Cotoscotos - the next walks are reintegration of a past and history of walking in a religious sense.
3. Ponpon - the next walks will be a burial of what are lost and a remembering
4. Onsalilig - the next walks will be an immersion and giving voice of the experiences of those like me who are on the sidelines of society
5. Calab - the next walks must feature a wide look at Pangasinan and things in there
6. Saliasio - the next shall be brave detours from used paths and the use of neglected paths as well as neglected stories of those who use those paths
7. Batac - the next walks shall be a way to create new paths
8. Dosdos - the next walks shall be a communion not just to human culture but also to nonhumans
9. Licaulicau - the next walks are about wandering

You dont have to use the last section to summarize. It is better if the sections stand by themselves and the insights are in the individual sections.
