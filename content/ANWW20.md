This is the acronym for the 20th Ateneo National Writer's Workshop organized by the Ateneo Institute of Literary Arts and Practices (AILAP) that ran from June 9â€“12, 2023.

Ten days before the deadline for passing entries on April 1, 2023, I collated my newsletter articles from Lilim and read the literature on [[Liminality]], [[Autoethnography]], and [[thoughts/walking]].

- [[Ideas on how to approach the ANWW20 entry]]
- [[Outline of entry to ANWW20]]
- [[Entry to ANWW20]]
- [[Unprocessed notes for ANWW20]]

When my entry was accepted, I prepared for my first national writers workshop:
- [[Advice for ANWW20]]
- [[ANWW20 Fellows]]
- [[ANWW20 Presentation]]

Before the workshop, I met with [[Louise Far]], and I had these ideas on walking when we were talking:
- What is archetypal in a walk?
- What does walk show?
- What are the effects of elements on walking?
- How to walk on water?
- How can you create a walking book?

During the workshop, here are my notes:

- [[ANWW20 Opening Remarks Allan Derain]]
