I shouldn't force myself to write walking excursions like Thoreau does or like I was planning to do if it isn't who I really am. I think that the vignette, the writing of excursions in all areas of life, not just within physical space, is what I truly wanted to do. Therefore, memoir. A retelling of experience either empirical or intellectual.
