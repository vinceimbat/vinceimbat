[[walking|Walking]] is [[meditation]]. Your mind still continues to function. But it fluctuates between thinking and experiencing. One can continue to think while walking. For some, like [[thoughts/friedrich nietzsche]], all thinking is done while walking. In fact, walking is a very potent thinking tool because [[walking changes your perspective]]. However, the very reason that triggers thinking while walking is also the trigger that stops one from thinking while walking, or at least tame the thinking mind to stop it from over-wandering. The physicality of a walk and one's exposure to Nature frequently leads to a total halt of walking, emptying the mind, and letting mere presence settle, which, in turn, makes thinking better (this reminds me of: [[Interjecting socialization in between intense mind work is fruitful]]).

Thus, [[thoughts/my thinking while walking strategy]].

> Walking, as they say, ‘empties the mind’. In another way, walking *fills* the mind with a different sense of purpose. Not connected with ideas or doctrines, not in the sense of a head full of phrases, quotations, theories: but full of the world’s presence. That presence which, during the walk, in successive strata, has been deposited in the soul throughout the day.
