Since [[Purpose is articulated before an action or a project is performed]], it answers the question "Why will you do what you will do?" The articulated reason is a desired [[End state]]. Therefore, the purpose articulated is a statement of the state one hopes to be in after the movement is performed.

We can have a purpose for one activity, one project, or an entire life (since [[thoughts/life is a project]]).
