The outside world can be seen by everyone. The inner world can only be seen by someone.

There is a necessary difference between the outside world and the concept created inn the mind when one experiences the outside world.

There is a necessar difference between one person's experience of the outside world and another. No two persons can have 100% similar experience for the same thing ([[Minds are unique to each human being]]).
