Diaries may not seem to conform to literary expectations such as meandering plots, dead ends, and repetition; however, they manage to engage the reader, arouse empathy and elicit emotional responses that many may be more inclined to associate with works of fiction. Blurring the lines between literary genres, diary writing can be considered a quasi-literary genre that offers a unique insight into the lives of those we may have otherwise never discovered.

diary-keepers explore their identity and understand themselves, their relationships, and the world around them using the diary.

the diary evolved and continues to evolve while remaining the same: space where one can reflect on the innermost part of themselves narrating 'real fiction' about their lives.
