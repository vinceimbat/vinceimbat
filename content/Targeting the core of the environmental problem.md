If we dont target the core of the envi problem which is the story of separation, we make things worse.

Whatever system we install and whatever changes we try to do if the consciousness, which is the building blocks of any system, is not changed, the systems will be useless.

Two ways

1. Change system -> consciousness follow (macro)
2. Change consciousness -> system change follows (micro/grassroots)

But we cant really do this one way, we need to be holisitic

1. Tuhugin ang problema hanggang mahanap ang dulo. Understanding, science
2. Then target the problem from bottom up and
3. Target problem top bottom
