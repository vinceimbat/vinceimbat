I capture [[fleeting notes]] into three inboxes:

1. I use the [[drafts app|Drafts]] app to capture notes on the fly.
2. I use an analog [[diary]] and pen (currently, Pilot G-2 10) to journal.

These inboxes are drained regularly in different schedules because [[efficient inboxes are reliably drained]]. Fleeting notes in Drafts and my diary are reviewed to identify interesting writing prompts. These prompts are transferred to the Craft inbox, which serve as a [[writing inbox]] for transient notes that will eventually be processed into [[evergreens]].
