This is unlike [[Ultralearning, after Young]], which seems to suggest doing more work. [[Josh Kaufman]]'s approach also uses rapid skill acquisition but encourages lesser time investment through the following steps:

1. Break down your learning project or skill into smaller projects or parts.
2. Identify which of those parts are most relevant and important to you.
3. Learn enough about these most relevant parts to be able to practice them and self-correct yourself.
4. Remove physical, mental, and emotional barriers to practice.
5. Use [[Deliberate practice]] to learn the most relevant parts for at least 20 hours or until you have achieved your target level of performance.

This process is obviously inspired by the [[Three-stage model of skill acquisition]]. I find this very compelling, given the nature of my monthly schedule. I want to be able to achieve learning goals within my free 26 days every month.
