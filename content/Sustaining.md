This [[thoughts/life area]] involves all activities related to supporting my material existence: livelihood, resource management, and skills expansion.

Here are the sub-ares under this area and their standards.

**Sustaining - Livelihood**

I have a resilient livelihood system with multiple streams of income that provides me with at least 40k per month through work that feels good. This system encourages me to transition towards doing work that brings me joy.

**Sustaining - Resource Management**

I make sure that each material and financial resource that comes my way supports my projects and values.

**Sustaining - Skills Expansion**

I am consistently improving my resilience by expanding my skills that allow me to be more profitable, job-flexible, and less reliant to money.
