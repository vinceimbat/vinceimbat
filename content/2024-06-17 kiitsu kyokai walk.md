Yesterday, I finished reading an article that has long been in my reading list. It was about climate change tribalism or the tendency of people to dehumanize others who hold a different climate change belief. This tendency isn't only happening in climate change debates. It happens in many places. When we become tribal, we prioritize our loyalty to our tribe over the truth. We refuse to change beliefs or to listen to opposing ideas for fear that we will be disowned by our tribes. This, I think, is the core of our tendency to be at war. When we are in war, we have an enemy that we want to eliminate. Everything has to be about this fight between good and evil. And we are always the "good." This is the story of separation that plagues all of us. The alternative is love and compassion—showing care and concern to the unloveable, to one's enemy. The alternative necessitates non-violence, moderation, and openness to change outside and inside. This is my position, a positionless position I'm exploring through jiyū shūkyō. Living according to the principles is my activism against war.
