Landmarks or comps are creative works or platforms that are examples of the creative work you aspire to create and that your reader universally know are the best examples of the kind of work you want to do. 

Use existing landmarks to understand what your potential reader already likes, how they would describe works similar to yours, and what the marketplace where your creative work will exist looks like. Since your potential audience already gravitated toward these landmarks, use to find them. Then turn the same landmarks into guideposts (i.e., using a guest post or comments) to guide your ideal audience to your gateway.

In creating guideposts, focus on the positive emotions people feel about similar work already, and redirect those emotions and attention to your own creations.
