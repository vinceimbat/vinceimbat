The problem is that this awakening that you are talking about seems to only happen among the intellegentsia, and most Filipinos become part of this intellegentsia when they survive poverty, go to college, learn, and hopefully learn the right things and read the right books. The problem is that awakening needs to happen in the masses, but cannot happen now because there is no mass intellegentsia. We dont have writer farmers, scholarly fishermen. The intellectuals, the academe have shut their iron doors from that part of the population. Almost no one reads among the masses.
