The easiest way to convey strong emotion in your photos is to photograph people who are already experiencing them.

It turns out that the true storytelling potential of any photo sits in the mind of the viewer, not the photographer. Each viewer is different and looks at the photo in a different way, so his or her mind is always in control of the ultimate meaning of the photo.

So if you just add enough mystery to the photo, the viewer fills in the blanks and potentially tells a much better story than the reality of the situation.

This also explains why you don't always need perfectly sharp photos if your goal is to tell a great story. In fact, the limitations of your camera can sometimes work in your favor if your goal is to tell interesting stories with your photos.

So the next time you take photos, focus on emotion and mystery.
