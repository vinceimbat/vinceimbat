To convey strong emotion in [[photography]], take photos of people who are already experiencing them.

To tell a story, use mystery, perhaps by using shadow and intentionally secluding elements of the photographs, to encourage the viewer to create their own meaning or to finish the story of the photograph.

Mystery could be created by intentionally using the limitations of your camera. For example, the lack of sharpness of a photograph could actually be its asset. It could tell a story.
