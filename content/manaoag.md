Town next to [[San Jacinto]] popular to its church and the miraculous stories and media coverages therein. My family was associated with a [[jw|JW]] congregation in Manaoag when we were children and our congregation at Sta. Maria had territories in this town. I've walked a lot of it. My last congregation as a JW also had territories in this municipality, so I've walked and been in a lot of barangays in this town.

This town is also the site of a study I helped move about the cumon tradition.
