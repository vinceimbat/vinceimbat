Writing is my main craft. I've cultivated an intimate relationship with writing since the [[depression]] diaries I kept in 2012, the notebooks I wrote on to cope with my health issues, the blogs I've written, the diaries I've been keeping since 2018, the [[talahardin]], the writing I've done with others—FLOW, Rem, Tungko, writing with Uwa and Lea, and even the writings I've sent for workshops and publications. What I've learned from all those writing is that writing for me is an act of reverence. I treat words that come out of me as valuable gems or seeds—miracles waiting to happen. This is an even deeper poetics than a walking poetics. To see my words and my writing as something that could build up a person in any way.

The challenge and calling then in terms of writing is how to keep it this way. How can I ensure that how I approach writing as a practice maintains this reverential treatment of it and how can I give birth to words that are truly a balm for others?

In addition, how can I build a writing life inspired by a spiritual quest, practice it happily every day, and at its own best time produce nurturing work for those who listen to me?

***

Writing is a vow I keep for myself (see [[journaling is sacred|journaling is sacred]]). Writing is not necessarily rest as it isn't always restful to confront the blank page. It takes works more often than not to produce even a single line of words. I remember how I learned to write and what lengths I had to take to get this far. And I can't help but feel amazed that this thing is what I say I do.

Feel free to practice different kinds of writing. No need to focus a lot on this. Let yourself practice and fail as long as you write.

- Philosophical (although don't make this very academic)
- Autobiographical
- Poetic
- Creative nonfiction

Define the different categories, topics.

Define your ideal reader.

Build community around your topics and writing.

But remember your real intention for doing this.

Remember that it is the practice which is important.

This is the main project: pieces of writing that achieves an intimate and close relationship with my reader. To listen to myself constantly as frequent as I can to wait for words, to bring forth. And to create with great craft work that achieves my goal.

***
You holding back from descriptions is a sign that you want to get to the point. It is impatience, an unwillingness to slow down. Your experience of providing more details to a scene is revelatory. Slow down.

[[journaling|Journaling]] and note-writing in my [[talahardin]] are the forms of writing I want to master and spend most of my time in; not creative or performative writing. If they become performative, so be it. I'll still learn craft, of course. But it will take a lesser role. My priority is how I can make my writing practice as authentic as possible, how it could reflect the meanderings of my life in as an honest way possible.

It should also feel good and fun. It should eventually help my tribe in their own journey. This is writing as ministry.
