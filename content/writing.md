Writing is a vow I keep for myself (see [[thoughts/journaling is sacred|journaling is sacred]]). Writing is not necessarily rest as it isn't always restful to confront the blank page. It takes works more often than not to produce even a single line of words. I remember how I learned to write and what lengths I had to take to get this far. And I can't help but feel amazed that this thing is what I say I do.

Feel free to practice different kinds of writing. No need to focus a lot on this. Let yourself practice and fail as long as you write.

- Philosophical (although don't make this very academic)
- Autobiographical
- Poetic
- Creative nonfiction

Define the different categories, topics.

Define your ideal reader.

Build community around your topics and writing.

But remember your real intention for doing this.

Remember that it is the practice which is important.

***
This is the main project: pieces of writing that achieves an intimate and close relationship with my reader. To listen to myself constantly as frequent as I can to wait for words, to bring forth. And to create with great craft work that achieves my goal.

***
You holding back from descriptions is a sign that you want to get to the point. It is impatience, an unwillingness to slow down. Your experience of providing more details to a scene is revelatory. Slow down
