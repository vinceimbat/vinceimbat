There are three parts to my [[thoughts/annual review|annual review]] process:

1. Aggregate the annual report.
2. Perform the core of the annual review.
3. Write the annual review article and publish it.

# Part I: Aggregate the annual report

1. Start the process on January 3 of the year (this is to give way for [[monthly financial review process|monthly financial review]] and [[monthly review|monthly review]] first).
2. Copy and paste the summary of each [[monthly reports|monthly report]] into a new [[annual reports|annual report]] using the [[templates/annual report|annual report template]].
3. Use the annual report to accomplish the core of the annual review.

# Part II: Perform the core of the annual review

1. [[gratitude lists|Gratitude list]]: Write a gratitude list.
2. [[thoughts/past and coming year questions|Past and coming year questions]]: Review my past year and think about the present year.
3. [[my life areas|My life areas]]: Review areas of responsibility and set new standards if needed.
4. [[thoughts/life goals|Life goals]]: Add new goals and corresponding projects in [[my life goals master list|my life goals master list]]. Refer to [[how to set goals|how to set goals]].
4. [[personal narrative vision|Personal narrative vision]]: Review last year’s personal narrative vision and write next year’s.
5. Routines and reviews: Review last year’s routines and update them if necessary. Re-evaluate the following:
	- [[my daily routine|my daily routine]]
	- [[review|review]]
7. Share the results of my annual review to the people who are important to me: my partner, family, friends, and colleagues.

# Part III: Write the annual review article and publish it

1. Use the previous year's annual review article, my list of goals from the previous year, and my list of goals in the coming year to write a draft of the previous year’s [[annual review article]].
2. Edit.
3. Format as a blog post, publish, then share in social media.
4. Format it as a newsletter article then send it to my email list.
