This book is the first self-published poetry book by [[Melchor Orpilla]]. Among all the poetry books in Pangasinan I read, this book is the most experimental and wide-ranging. However, it uses a lot of unfamiliar words that one needs an access to a good Pangasinan dictionary to understand a poem. Accessing a Pangasinan dictionary is, of course, difficult.
