Safe spaces can sometimes keep us from being brave.

Being very supportive of each other's choices and paths can make us feel reluctant to ask each other hard questions or challenge unhealthy patterns. This can make growth and healing difficult.

Politeness can create a safe space but not a brave space.

When a space is too safe and we’ve become comfortable in that safety, we don’t want to challenge it, we don’t want to say anything that will rock the boat, and we don’t want to offend anyone else lest they abandon us. One of the results is that we become reluctant to be too vulnerable because our shadows might scare the other people away. We choose comfort over courage and we chase away or silence anyone who threatens that comfort.

where there is deep care and love. Sometimes we mistake “care” with “letting people stay comfortable in old patterns”. And sometimes we assume that holding space is only about providing safe space where a person feels free of judgement and free of the need to change or grow. Holding space, though, is much more complex than that.

there are times when we need to be held in safety without any pressure to change our behaviour or our choices. Especially when healing from trauma or when deep in new grief, safety is paramount and should not be compromised.

ALSO a feeling of safety is usually a first step in establishing enough trust so that we CAN step into bravery.

In fact some people who cling to their own safety do harm to others in the process.

**Check-in about people’s readiness for more bravery.** A community that’s thrust into bravery without preparation and/or discernment about their readiness can quickly become fractured beyond repair. Start with a hard conversation, revealing what you believe to be true about an over-reliance on safety, and ask people whether they feel emotionally stable enough to try something different.

**Build trust that can support bravery.**

Trust-building involves keeping stories confidential, showing up when you promise to show up, being an engaged listener, withholding scorn, and being dependable.

Inspire some to be brave so others will follow.

**Invite an outsider to serve as the mirror.**

Use a talking piece.

**Practice asking braver questions.** If people have indicated a readiness for brave space, then start by asking braver questions that invite new perspectives and growth.

ask “are you ready for a brave question?” If the person says yes, they’ll offer something that will invite the person to see their story through a new lens. A brave question might be something like “What might change if you let go of this resentment?” or “How are you trying to protect yourself from pain?” or “Do you believe you’re worthy of more happiness?” (For more brave questions, check out [50 Questions that Could Change Your Life](https://heatherplett.com/questions/).)

**Take care of each other.**Stepping into bravery and vulnerability can leave us feeling tender and raw, and that’s a time when community support is even more necessary. If you are in a transition period with your community/family/partnership/etc., where you’re learning to be more brave, make sure you’re also setting aside extra time for play, self-care, group-care, and laughter.
