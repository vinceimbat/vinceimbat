The [[talahardin]] can only work well if it has a lot of quality notes—meaning notes that have been processed by putting them into your own words and thinking about their relationship to existing notes in the slipbox.

To collect only quality notes in the Talakahon, it is important to distinguish between notes in [[talahardin taxonomy of note types]].
