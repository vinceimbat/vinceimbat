One way to solve meaninglessness is to be part of something larger: a political or social cause, providing a better life for your children and their descendants, or becoming a religious servant of God.

However, even if one's life is given meaning by being part of something larger, that larger thing could not escape the questionâ€”what is its purpose? Either it has a purpose by being part of a larger thing or it doesn't have a purpose. If the larger thing which our life is attached to is pointless, then it should be okay to accept that [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless]]. Such is the reason why [[Using God as the ultimate purpose is problematic]].
