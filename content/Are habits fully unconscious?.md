The basic unit of behavior is an [[thoughts/action]]. Action is the outward expression of internal processes like cue, craving, and reward. A repeated action becomes a [[Habit]]. A habit is always an opportunity to practice and because of this opportunity, some habits are not 100% automativ and unconscious actions. Their cue might be unconscious but they themselves, the doing of the action, can be conscious. Approached this way, even little actions can be considered a practice. And one's intention gives meaning to this practice.
