I heard this from a talk I watched at Mises Institute. I need to look that talk up again. But it basically says that we have a single list of wants and we arrange that list according to what is more valuable for us. Therefore, [[what to do now is the most critical decision]].

This idea is similar to [[getting things done]] that says there is a single projects list.
