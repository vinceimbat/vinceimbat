Life is super complex (see [[Planning an entire life is impossible]]). Our [[thoughts/life management system]] needs to be simple to accomodate our mind's limitations (see [[A life management system should free your mind]]; [[Build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]]). But it shouldn't be very simple that it fails to accomodate complexity.

Complexity should be allowed in a life management system. And visual reminders of the complexity should exist lest we forget about this fact.

But the frequency of reviews simplifies life’s complexity. I cannot handle the entire complexity in one moment. But I can do so in different moments scattered across intervals.

This is [[Design]]. Design allows for an efficient life system, one where actions are managed and are in integrity with higher-level convergence tools like [[thoughts/purpose]] and [[Goal]]s.

To do

- "And visual reminders of the complexity should exist lest we forget about this fact.” What do you mean by this?
