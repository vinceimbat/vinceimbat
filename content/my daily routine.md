My daily objective is to nurture all [[my life areas|my life areas]] but doing something for each. I assign each life area to a time block.

| Morning       | Afternoon and Evening |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Understanding | Overseeing            |
| Creating      | Sustaining            |
|               | Connecting            |
|               | Restoring             |

The important thing to remember is that my mornings should be used to strengthen my religious and spiritual life as well as my writing life. In other words, they should be used to practice *being* and *thinking*. A successful morning for me is one when I felt I existed, read, wrote, and thought deeply, which should help me make progress on at least one specific subject.

Afternoons and evenings, on the other hand, are for tasks that require me to jump from one thing to another. Because of this, they are less structured than mornings.

# Pre-desk (~8:00–8:15)

- Wash face.
- Weigh in.
- Drink two glasses of water.

# Core block (8:15–9:00)

Core block is non-negotiable. If a project requires more time, I could forgo of subsequent phases of my morning routine to accommodate it, except my core routine.

- Meditate.
- Write [[5MJ]].
- Review [[menu]], projects, and prompts (to get a sense of what I'd like to do).

# Uninterrupted morning block (~9:00–12:00)

## Rules

- Forest on my phone
- No social media and email
- Alone at my desk
- No meetings
- Work in 25 m/5 m pomodoros, sticking on one task
- No extended breaks (maintain momentum, not combat fatigue)

Details here are allowed to change depending on my projects and their status.

- If a project is available, see my menu or open [[things|Things]] and perform what to do from a set of preplanned actions prepared during the [[weekly review|weekly review]]).
- If a project is unavailable, perform [[my note-writing practice|my note-writing practice]].
- I'm also allowed to use this block to read through a stack of material necessary for me to understand something.

# Lunch Break (12:00–1:30)

- Lunch.
- Take two Vitamin C capsules.
- Dishes.
- Brush my teeth.
- Take a bath.

# Unstructured Time (~1:30–5:00)

Usually, I begin this time to accomplish the following tasks.

- Read one poem.
- Write daily review report (See [[my daily review routine|my daily review routine]]).
- Process yesterday's seeds.
- Process at least one previous diary entry.
- Push changes in my [[talahardin]] to Github.
- Process yesterday’s photos (if any).
- Connect with at least one contact.
- (Optional) Write and share for social media.

This block could also be used for the following:

- Day job
- Projects, tasks, admin work, and meetings
- Siesta
- Merienda

# Field work (5:00–7:00)

- I go out for a walk and perform [[thoughts/my daily walking routine|my daily walking routine]].

# Dinner (7:00–10:00)

- Dinner.
- Time with Lea.

# Wind Down (10:30–12:00)
