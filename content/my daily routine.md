My daily objective is to nurture all [[my life areas|my life areas]] but doing something for each. I assign each life area to a time block.

| Morning       | Afternoon and Evening |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Understanding | Overseeing            |
| Creating      | Sustaining            |
|               | Connecting            |
|               | Restoring             |

The important thing to remember is that my mornings should be used to strengthen my religious and spiritual life as well as my writing life. In other words, they should be used to practice *being* and *thinking*. A successful morning for me is one when I felt I existed, read, wrote, and thought deeply, which should help me make progress on at least one specific subject.

# Pre-desk (~8:00–9:00)

- Wake up.
- Feed my cats.
- Wash my face.
- Walk with Lea (if she is awake).
- Weigh in.
- Drink two glasses of water.

# Uninterrupted morning block (~9:00–12:00)

## Rules
- Forest on my phone
- No social media and email
- Alone at my desk
- No meetings
- Work in 25 m/5 m pomodoros, sticking on one task
- No extended breaks (maintain momentum, not combat fatigue)

## Core block

Core block is non-negotiable. If a project requires more time, I could forgo of subsequent phases of my morning routine to accommodate it, except my core routine.

- Meditate.
- Read one poem.
- Write [[5MJ]].
- Open and back up laptop.
- Write a [[thoughts/daily working log|daily working log]]; look at the [[menu]] for the week to get a sense of what I'd like to do.

## Writing block

Details here are allowed to change depending on my projects and their status.

- If a project is available, see my menu or open [[thoughts/things|Things]] and perform what to do from a set of preplanned actions prepared during the [[weekly review|weekly review]]).
- If a project is unavailable, perform [[thoughts/my morning writing practice|my morning writing practice]].
- I am also allowed to just use to read through a stack of material if that is what's necessary.

## Miscellaneous

About an hour or 30 minutes before lunch break, I spend some time doing the following.

- Write daily review report (See [[my daily review routine|my daily review routine]]).
- Process yesterday's seeds.
