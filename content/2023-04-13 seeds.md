Ibang klaseng maka-alala ng katawan

Kapag naglalakad ako, hindi rin ako sigurado kanino ako nakikipagniig. Sa katawan ko ba o sa tanawin. O sa isipan ko.

I think that my enamor with words arose from scarcity. I grew up in a family where very little words were spoken, where important subjects were left out of conversations.

And so, sometimes, I feel like I am writing too much and saying too much. Just to keep up will all those years when there was too little words to say.
