Monothetic definitions contra [[Polythetic definitions of religion]] are the most popular definitions of the concept of religion. These definitions require one property or one set of properties before something can be called a religion. The property or set of properties can either be the substance ([[Substantive definitions of religion]]) or function ([[Functional definitions of religion]]) of the religion. Either way, monothetic definitions are binary: a form of life can either be  a religion or not.

Edward Tylor's belief in spiritual beings and Paul Tillich's ultimate concern are monothetic definitions that use a single criterion. Meanwhile, the [[Five elements of a religion per Herbert]] and [[Five elements of a religion per Clifford Geertz]] are examples of monothetic definitions that use a set of criteria.

> Most of the attempts to analyze the term have been “monothetic” in that they operate with the classical view that every instance that is accurately described by a concept will share a defining property that puts them in that category.

> Monothetic approaches use a single property (or a single set of properties) as the criterion that determines whether a concept applies. The key to a monothetic approach is that it proposes necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the given class. That is, a monothetic approach claims that there is some characteristic, or set of them, found in every religion and that if a form of life has it, then that form of life is a religion. Most definitions of the concept religion have been of this type.

Similarly, Paul Tillich proposes ultimate concern as a functional criterion that distinguishes religion from non-religion in terms of what serves this particular role in one’s life. These are single criterion monothetic definitions.

>  Whether a monothetic approach focuses on one essential property or a set, and whether that essence is the substance or the function of the religion, those using this approach ask a Yes/No question regarding a single criterion. This approach therefore typically produces relatively clear lines between what is and is not religion.
