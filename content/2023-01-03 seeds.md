A convergence tool is so precious because it takes a long time to arrive at it and even if you feel like you've arrived, you later learn you were wrong. Whenever you commit and feel hell yeah, that is your biggest win because it took you a long time and a lot of trial and error to arrive at commitment. This is esp true if you are minimalist in your beliefs and you don't easily trust people or ideas.

When you are in search of convergence tools it is important for you to note your insights and then record them and then return to them. An annual review is so useful here because it shows you patterns; things that you constantly returned to and ideas that you slowly furnished.
