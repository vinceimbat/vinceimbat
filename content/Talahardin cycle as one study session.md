To implement the cycle effectively, delineate how much time you are going to use for studying. Two hours a day is an ideal length. Divide these hours into shorter intervals like a 25:5 minutes work-to-break ratio.

Hopefully, by keeping a [[Reading inbox]], it will be easier for you to identify what material to read. But if this isn't clear yet, allocate a few minutes of the cycle for metalearning and research. You need to limit this time though to [[Avoid collecting information]]. Do the same with the next phases, allocating time appropriately and fitting these within the 25:5 minutes intervals.

The reason for cutting a work session into shorter breaks is because it is easier to determine the best action moving forward if the sessions are short ([[Working with externalized small tasks encourages focus]]; [[Break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]]).
