Editing is a skill that requires at least a month to get better into.

The standards I am trying to achieve with editing is too high esp if I am going to continue editing for Scribendi-like companies.

If I really want to do good and stay competitive as an editor, I need to invest a lot of time. Deepen my knowledge of English. Take IELTS? Get a masters degree.

With copywriting, I have a sure job with Lea. And I can start there as I build my portfolio.

The question is this: Is it worth investing such time into developing a skill whose enjoyability is questionable?

Even if I won't be doing editing forever, it is still worth trying to apply to editing jobs available.

If I choose editing, in a way, I am choosing a counterbalance jobâ€”a job which is an entirely different world from creativity and spirituality, which also requires some time investment.

Editing encourages perfectionism and following rules. By nature, I want to communicate more freely and to let go of rules as much as possible.

If my dayjob is writing instead of editing, then I will be forced to get better at writing even if that is copywriting.

## How to build an editing business

There are three projects:
1. Establish a safety net (an editing agency that does the marketing).
2. Establish a clientelle via a freelancing platform like Upwork.
3. Establish a clientelle using your own editing website.

The projects must be pursued in this order.

Once project 1 is achieved, I want to spend at least one month doing an ultra-learning project to improve my editing skills with a hands-on application at my new safety net.

An alternative to establishing a clientelle in Upwork is to find a second editing agency.

The third project involves integrating services that are closer to what you are really passionate about like writing coach or developmental editing.
