Near the animal science buildings, I see this old tower-like structure that looks like a long chimney. I walk toward it and take some photos from below. The tower is part of a network of buildings that look older than others on the campus, and with face-to-face classes still not fully back, they look more aged and abandoned. I follow the path that cleaved between the buildings, leading me to a heavily graffitied two-story structure that reminded me of stables in cowboy films. The second floor looks like a large conference hall, while the first floor comprises smaller rooms that were, perhaps, previously offices. I study the writings from afar, admiring this piece of public art. Suddenly, a guard appears out of nowhere and starts walking toward me. I look back at the graffitis and take one last photo, pretending not to care. Then I started walking back to where I came from, at a pace faster than usual, doing what any graffiti artist would do.
