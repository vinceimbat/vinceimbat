I have many interests. This can be overwhelming especially when I need to choose what [[thoughts/action]] to take. And because [[My immediate problems involve deciding what actions to take]], this means that I can only make progress if I am able to streamline my decision-making process in this regard.

[[Purpose is a convergence tool]]. Having a purpose is a shorthand for deciding what action to take, which also involves what projects to pursue. For example, [[Purpose differentiates between primary and secondary interests]]. It creates a hierarchy of interests that immediately shows which projects to prioritize. [[Primary interests]] are more closely relevant to one's purpose than [[Secondary interests]].

Here is [[My current hierarchy of interests]].
