Study how Fr. Martin uses writing for his end.
The danger of studying MA CW is that I might lost this intimate relationship with my craft and losing spiritualized experience of writing that I want to develop.

If a degree in MA CW would help me in my vocation and calling then I'll do it. Right now, I'm still unsure.

Might ask my mentors.

What are my priorities?

1. Building faith in myself.
2. Building faith in others.
3. Building faith in society.
4. Building faith in life and nature.
5. Building faith in a church.
6. Building faith in a religion.
7. Building faith in free religion.
