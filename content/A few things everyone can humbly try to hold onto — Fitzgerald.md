_So hard at best is the human lot, and so great is the beauty we can apprehend, that only a religious conception of things can take in the extremes and meet the case._

_It seems to me there are a few things everyone can humbly try to hold onto: love and mercy (and humor) in everyday living: the quest for exact truth in language and affairs of the intellect: self-recollection or prayer: and the peace, the composed energy of art._

— Robert Fitzgeral
