If my depression of 2011 didn't happen, I would've continued to focus on the big thoughts and questions of life. But since it happened, I have become more concerned about the practicality of knowledge ([[pragmatism]]) and how all of them relate to a single practical question: [[how to live]].

An experience, specially a difficult one, makes us trust our experiences more. It makes us more interested in them and makes us learn from them more.
