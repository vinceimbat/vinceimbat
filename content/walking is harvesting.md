From Thomas Mitchell, a farmer:

>One of the best secrets of a happy life is the art of extracting comfort and sweetness from every circumstanceâ€¦
>
>People are always looking for happiness at some future time and in some new thing, or some new set of circumstances, in possession of which they some day expect to find themselves. But the fact is, if happiness is not found now, where we are, and as we are, there is little chance of it ever being found. There is a great deal more happiness around us day by day than we have the sense or power to seek and find.

>If we are to cultivate the art of living, we should cultivate the art of extracting sweetness and comfort out of everything, as the bee goes from flower to flower in search of honey.

From [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau]]:

> We pass haymakers in every meadow, who may think that we are idlers. But Nature takes care that every nook and crevice is explored by someone. While they look after the open meadows, we farm the tract between the riverâ€™s brinks and behold the shores from that side. We, too, are harvesting an annual crop with our eyes, and think you Nature is not glad to display her beauty to us?
