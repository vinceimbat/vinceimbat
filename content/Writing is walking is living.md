The page is a metaphor for [[thoughts/living]]. [[thoughts/writing]], [[thoughts/walking]], and living all share a similar trajectory: They begin at one point and end in another, but that end point is often unpredictable, unexpected, and unplanned. In writing, walking, and living, we allow ourselves to be present because being present allows us to see changes as they happen in real time and respond to them.
