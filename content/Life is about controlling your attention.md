According to [[craig mod]], life is all about controlling your attention. Controlling your attention enhances your appreciation and ability to savor the current life you have. This protects you from thinking about the regrets of the past and the worries of the future.

The past and the future are things out of your control anyway. You need to [[Focus on what you can control]], and [[The only thing you can truly control is your attention]].

To control your attention, you have to:

1. Identify what is worth paying attention to.
2. Develop the ability to pay attention (i.e., clearing the mind, being less distracted, being still).
3. Use that ability to nurture what is worth paying attention to.

If your current life is something that is important to you, you will pay more attention to it. A good method to experiencing Ginhawa is to develop attention to my own thoughts and environment. This is something I hope to accomplish in my daily routine. In the morning, I pay attention to my thoughts and develop them through writing in my [[Diary]] and [[thoughts/talahardin]]. In the afternoon, I go outdoors and develop savoring and paying attention by mindful walking and photography.

Take note: You don't have to pay attention to everything. You just have to be absolutely paying attention as best as you can. This is related to [[you cannot save everyone]]
