The term "nontheism" was created to avoid the negative baggage that comes with the label [[atheism]]. Many atheists are actively against religionâ€”as dogmatic and fundamentalistic as the religious people they attack. Those who want to distance themselves from this active rejection of religion but who still share the same disbelief to God choose to call themselves nontheists.

## From Andrew Brown

- [[a walk to megs mount brown]]

- 1 If no perfectly loving God exists, then God does not exist.
- 2 If a perfectly loving God exists, then there is a God who is always open to personal relationship with each human person.
- 3 If there is a God who is always open to personal relationship with each human person, then no human person is ever non-resistantly unaware that God exists.
- 4 If a perfectly loving God exists, then no human person is ever non-resistantly unaware that God exists (from 2 and 3).
- 5 Some human persons are non-resistantly unaware that God exists.
- 6 No perfectly loving God exists (from 4 and 5).
- 7 God does not exist (from 1 and 6).

this is not to say that "Divine reality" (Schallenberg's own term) may not be real and experienced by us but it is (very strongly) to suggest that this Divine reality is unlikely to be the personal God of theism.
