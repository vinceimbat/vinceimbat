The term "nontheism" was created to avoid the negative baggage that comes with the label [[atheism]]. Many atheists are actively against religionâ€”as dogmatic and fundamentalistic as the religious people they attack. Those who want to distance themselves from this active rejection of religion but who still share the same disbelief to God choose to call themselves nontheists.
