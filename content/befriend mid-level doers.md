Befriend people who have already engaged an audience similar to the one you want for your work. These are people who have deep experience within your field.

Mid-level doers should be your priority because they are successful but still accessible. Find them in both formal and informal media. To look for them, ask these questions:
- Who shows up to conferences or events, workshops, and online chats?
- Whom does your ideal audience already know and respect in their field?

A particularly good place to find mid-level doers is podcasts in your field. The podcaster themselves is someone you should focus on. The list of people interviewed is a great place to begin in identifying additional mid-level doers.
