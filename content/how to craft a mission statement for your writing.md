Write a simple sentence that 
1. Articulates something you believe strongly in.
2. Articulates the experience you want your writing to create for others. 

Your reader's experience should describe transformation, i.e., how a reader changed months after reading your book. You can use the following questions to think about this:
- What do you want them to think quietly in their heads about the world you have opened for them?
- How does it relate to their life, their identity, their interactions?

Try to be as clear and as unshakeable as possible.
