Jiyu shukyo doesn't mean not taking a stand. In fact it encourages you to listen, stop, and then take a stand when it is what the situation requires. One can say that walking is still standing although very briefly at any given point. The point of jiyu shukyo is one can take a stand, just be continuously open about other stands and never firmly attached to one stand. Jiyu shukyo is the stand of walking and not standing too long at one place lest seeing the world in only one angle.
