According to [[John Tyler Williamson]], the weakness of the [[Golden Butterfly portfolio]] is that it uses gold and solely relies on US stocks. To address this weakness, substitute gold with TIP and [[REIT]] and introduce international stocks.

Here is a modified version of this portfolio using [[eToro]] that addresses the above weaknesses.

- 20% Total World Stock Market (VT)
- 20% Total World Small Cap Value (VBR 10%; DLS 10%)
- 20% Long-term Bonds (VGLT) → TLT
- 20% Short-term Bonds (VGSH) → BSV
- 10% TIPS (TIP)
- 10% REITS (VNQ)
