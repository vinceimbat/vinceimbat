## Reframe dysfunctional beliefs

Dysfunctional beliefs prevent so many people from designing the life they want.

Reframing questions and problems is one of the most important mind-sets of a designer.

Examples of dysfunctional beliefs:
- Your degree determines your career. Reframe: 3/4 of all collefe grads don't end up working in a career related to their majors.
- True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you. Reframe: True happiness comes from designing a life that works for you.

## Encore career

An “encore” career involves work that combines personal meaning, continued income, and social impact.

## Design thinking might be the best approach in living life

When emotions are involved, design thinking has proved to be the best problem-solving tool.

Aesthetics is the ultimate design problem as it involves human emotion.

Life can’t be perfectly planned.

Life is ever-changing. There is no destination to arrive to, only death. There is no question to answer once and for all.
- This is tightly connected with Andrew J. Brown's idea of a fluid life philosophy built on sand.

What people need is a process—a design process—for figuring out what they want, whom they want to grow into, and how to create a life they love.

It’s never too late to design a life you love.

To do
- The best way to write this note is to describe the nature of life first (i.e., no clear goal, cannot be planned)

## Designing your life doesn’t involve a clear goal

- Connect here why life doesn't always start with a purpose.

Because life doesn't have a clear goal or destination (or at least not at first), you use the following approach:
- brainstorm
- try "crazy stuff"
- improvise
- build your way forward until you come up with something that works

Designers embrace change. They are not attached to a particular outcome, because they are always focused on what will happen next—not what the final result will be.

## What a well-designed life looks like

A well-designed life has a look and feel all of its own—a beautiful aesthetic that speaks to you.

A well-designed life is a life that is generative—it is constantly creative, productive, changing, evolving, and there is always the possibility of surprise. It is not repetitive.

A well-designed life is not a life of drudgery. You weren’t put on this earth to work eight hours a day at a job you hate until the time comes to die.

## Start with empathy

Every design started with a problem.

“Don’t start with the problem, start with the people, start with empathy.”

- Start by empathizing by the person using your life: You.
- Once you have empathize with yourself, brainstorm to create a prototype that you will use to discover what you don't know yet.
- We allow what we discover to pivot, i.e. to reframe our original point of view and modify or change our prototype.

## One life can have many designs

There isn’t just one solution to your life. There are many designs for your life, all filled with hope for the kind of creative and unfolding reality that makes life worth living into. Your life is not a thing, it’s an experience; the fun comes from designing and enjoying the experience.

There are many versions of you, and they are all “right.” And life design will help you live into whatever version of you.

Try stuff.

## What life design is

Life design is about imagining a life you want, building it, and seeing something that has never existed before emerge.

You have three goals:
1. To conceive of and pursue a life and career you really wanted.
2. To have as few dysfunctional beliefs as possible.
3. To increase your ability to generate new ideas for your life design.

A well-designed life is a life that makes sense. It’s a life in which who you are, what you believe, and what you do all line up together. When you have a well-designed life and someone asks you, “How’s it going?,” you have an answer. You can tell that person that your life is going well, and you can tell how and why. A well-designed life is a marvelous portfolio of experiences, of adventures, of failures that taught you important lessons, of hardships that made you stronger and helped you know yourself better, and of achievements and satisfactions. It’s worth emphasizing that failures and hardships are a part of every life, even the well-designed ones.

## Build a team that will support you in your life design

Get a design team. Read the book together. Do the exercises together. Collaborate to support one another in designing your lives.

The different backgrounds in your group assures that you generate truly unique solutions.

***

## Have a bias to action

Before you can do life design, you need to learn to think like a designer.

Designers don’t think their way forward. Designers build their way forward.

you are not just going to be dreaming up a lot of fun fantasies that have no relationship to the real world—or the real you. You are going to build things (we call them prototypes), try stuff, and have a lot of fun in the process.

## Build the mindsets of a designer

The five mind-sets you are going to learn in order to design your life are curiosity, bias to action, reframing, awareness, and radical collaboration. These are your design tools, and with them you can build anything, including a life you love.

- **Curiosity.** Curiosity makes everything new. It invites exploration. It makes everything play. Most of all, curiosity is going to help you “get good at being lucky.” It’s the reason some people see opportunities everywhere.
- **Bias to action.** When you have a bias to action, you are committed to building your way forward. Create prototypes to try things and use the results of those trials to solve or reframe the original problem.
- **Reframing.** Reframing is essential to finding the right problems and the right solutions. Learn to step back, examine your biases, and open new solutions.
- **Awareness.** Learn to let go of the first idea or of a good but not great solution. Learn to see designs from the mess. Let go of the end goal of life and focus on the process—on what is next.
- **Radical collaboration.** Many of the best ideas about how to live your life will come from other people. Know how to ask and identify the right questions to ask.

## Passion comes after mastery

only one in five young people between twelve and twenty-six have a clear vision of where they want to go, what they want to accomplish in life, and why.

80 percent of people of all ages don’t really know what they are passionate about.

Developing a passion takes time. Passion comes after trying something, realizing one wants it, and developing a mastery of it.

Passion is a result of a good life design, not the cause.

***

## There is no one passion that rules them all

Most people do not have that one thing they are passionate about—that singular motivator that drives all of their life decisions and infuses every waking moment with a sense of purpose and meaning.

In truth, most people are passionate about many different things, and the only way to know what they want to do is to prototype some potential lives, try them out, and see what really resonates with them. We are serious about this: you don’t need to know your passion in order to design a life you love. Once you know how to prototype your way forward, you are on the path to discovering the things you truly love, passion or not.

## Engaging in life design increases your luck

We can assure you that at times it will take you out of your comfort zone.

What happens when you engage in life design? Actually, something quite extraordinary happens. Things you want start to show up in your life. You start to hear of job openings you were dreaming about. People you were interested in meeting just happen to be in town. What is happening here? For starters, it’s that “getting good at being lucky” thing we mentioned earlier, a result of curiosity and awareness, and a by-product of using the five mind-sets. In addition, the process of discovering who you are and what you want has a rather extraordinary effect on your life. There will be effort and action involved, no doubt, but it will seem, rather surprisingly, as if everyone is conspiring to help you. And, by being aware of the process, you will have a lot of fun along the way.

## Unsorted

The reframe for the question “What do you want to be when you grow up?” is this: “Who or what do you want to grow into?”
