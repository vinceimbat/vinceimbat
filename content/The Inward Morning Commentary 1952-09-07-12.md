For six days (September 7–12), [[thoughts/henry bugbee]] fleshes out one of his lengthier entries. After his discussion on experience[^1], he introduces two new concept but simply mentions them: immersion and commitment. He then narrates three memories he had—experience—which I think he will dig for meaning in the coming entries. The narratives are entitled Swamping, Building a Dam, and Rowing. He writes them beautifully, which convinces me of the power of poetry to inform one's prose.
