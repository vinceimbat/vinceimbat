Gratitude is more than just saying thank you. Gratitude is transcendental because when you are thankful for something, you see the wonder of its existence, you recognize that this thing exists but it doesnâ€™t have to, and yet it is here for you to enjoy. I have been this way even before I started doing the gratitude journal. I am sentimental. I give too much weight on things and grieve longer than others.
