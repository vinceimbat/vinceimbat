[[The only thing you can truly control is your attention]]. In fact, [[Life is about controlling your attention]]. Therefore, the quality of one’s life is directly proportional to how one controls one’s attention. For this to happen though, one needs [[Freedom]]. The more one has freedom to do what one has to do, the happier one can become.
