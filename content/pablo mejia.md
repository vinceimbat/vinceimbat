An old Pangasinan writer whose book [[bilay tan kalkalar nen rizal mejia|Bilay tan Kalkalar nen Rizal]] also contains an initial orthography for the [[Pangasinan]] language. [[Melchor Orpilla]] sent me this book, although I first heard of him from [[Dean Alfred Narra]].

Here is the [[Pangasinan orthography by Mejia]].
