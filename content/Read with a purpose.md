The goal of my reading is develop a writing voice by exposing myself to different writers and studying those that move me.

What kind of material am I looking to read?

- English or Filipino
- Written in the Filipino context
- Personal writing that penetrates the soul, craftily constructed through a demonstration of strong handle of literary tools and devices. Talks about the big questions or leads the reader to be philosophical, to be in awe.
- Ideally they walk and talk about nature.
