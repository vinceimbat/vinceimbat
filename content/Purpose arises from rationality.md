Our need for [[thoughts/purpose]], both of individual actions and our life as a whole, sprouts from our rational nature. After all, [[Purpose is a statement that articulates the reason behind an action]]. As conscious human beings, we do things not just out of subconscious instincts, but through conscious intelligent reasons ([[Purpose is conscious]]).

The rational necessity of purpose is specially true when using it as a convergence tool ([[Purpose is a convergence tool]]) to organize one's life. Arriving at an organizing principle requires a lot of rationalizing ([[find your purpose through divergenceâ€“convergence]]).
