Holding on to the past can prevent us from fully being in the present, from responding with compassion, kindness, calm, and humility. Presence is needed because it leads to certainty of action words that are both decisive and feels right. If we hold on to the past, an identity based on it crystalizes. Once it crystalizes, we may no longer escape it. When this happens, change becomes difficult.
