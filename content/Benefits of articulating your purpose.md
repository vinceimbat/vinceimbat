Although it can be difficult to articulate, articulating your [[purpose]] has many benefits. Here are some of its benefits:
- Since [[purpose is a convergence tool]], once you have articulated it, [[Purpose organizes your life]].
- You can use purpose as a filter for the information that flows into your life. You can implement a rule to [[Only consume information that is relevant to your purpose]].
- [[Purpose differentiates between primary and secondary interests]].
- [[Purpose is ideally motivational]]

After realizing these benefits, you may want to start articulating your purpose. When you are ready, see [[how to articulate purpose]].
