Although it can be difficult to articulate, articulating your [[purpose]] has many benefits. Here are some of its benefits:

- Since [[purpose is a convergence tool]], once you have articulated it, [[purpose organizes your life]].
- You can use purpose as a filter for the information that flows into your life. You can use it to [[consume information selectively]].
- [[Purpose differentiates interests]].
- [[Purpose is motivational]].

After realizing these benefits, you may want to start articulating your purpose. When you are ready, see [[how to articulate purpose]].
