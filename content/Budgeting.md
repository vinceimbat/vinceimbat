Budgeting woke me up to the fact that I have goals that require money and that the lump of cash I own can't simply be a lump of cash. Each dollar needs to have a job. It could feel a but overwhelming because one realizes how too many things one wants. But the exercise is necessary if we want to really have a finer handle of reality.
