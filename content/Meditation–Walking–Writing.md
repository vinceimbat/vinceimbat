Meditation trains the true self, the watcher, to become as present as possible, to be here and now, in the body—embodied—at all times. I use this acquired mindfulness to see myself, the Other, and the physical world better while walking. Then, writing is the creative outlet of whatever happens in these walks. It is a way to capture, integrate, and communicate insights and experiences—all to make life richer.
