I have brought to life a creative spirituality—a way of life—customized to my needs, personality, and strengths. It is a free and inquiring spirituality that is also anchored to my culture. This creative spirituality informs how I exist in the world—my daily practices, the work that I do, and how I act. While it liberates me, it also strengthens my faith and connection with my *kapwa* both the human and the non-human. I'm part of a community of individuals walking on the same path who support me in the realization of my vision.
