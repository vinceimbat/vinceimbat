I have brought to life a creative [[spirituality]]—a way of life—customized to my needs, personality, and strengths. It is a [[jiyu shukyo|free and inquiring spirituality]] that is also anchored to my culture. This creative spirituality informs how I exist in the world—[[my daily routine|my daily practices]], the work that I do, and how I [[action|act]]. While it liberates me, it also strengthens my faith and connection with my *kapwa* both the human and the non-human. I'm part of a [[kiitsu kyokai|community]] of individuals walking on the same path who support me in the realization of my vision.
