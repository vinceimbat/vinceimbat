This is one of the main principles of emergent strategy by [[adrienne maree brown]].

>to have a general idea of where I want us to go, then pay attention to what's happening in the room, and trust that what's needed will come--through me or through others. This is a growing edge but one I'm interested in exploring. There's freedom in feeling like I'm already enough; I don't need to hustle for more.
