Your priority is not wild success. Your priority is to continue sharing your voice and your vision with new work for as many years as possible. Your priority is for your work to change the lives of others for the better over the long run.

If this sustainability built by slow organic growth gives you more chances of serendipitous luck, then good. If not, it isn'y your priority any way.
