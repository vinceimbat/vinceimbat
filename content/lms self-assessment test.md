This test is ideally taken before and after going through the [[building a minimum viable lms program|Building a Minimum Viable LMS Program]]. It was taken from the [[getting things done|Getting Things Done]] workbook.

Rate yourself according to this scale:
1 = strongly disagree
2 = disagree
3 = neither agree nor disagree
4 = agree
5 = strongly agree

1. I write down ideas and to-do items when they first show up.
2. I keep a complete list of all my next actions.
3. I keep a record of what I am waiting for from other people.
4. My calendar contains only the necessary appointments or day-specific information.
5.  I have a single list of all my current projects.
6. I have at least one recorded next action for each of my projects.
7. I get my email inbox to zero every day or so by going through each email and putting it where it belongs.
8. I can easily store and access reference material when needed, whether paper or digital.
9. I have designated in-trays in all the places I need to capture all my incoming paper and stuff.
10. I get my paper in-tray(s) to empty every day or so.
11. When I get behind or overwhelmed, I know how to get back on track by engaging with my next actions, projects, and calendar.
12. I take time each week to get caught up and to review how I am doing with my professional/personal work.
13. I have a trusted place I can easily find and look at to see additional/support information about any project I am working on.
14. I have a framework I can use to choose best what to work on at any particular time.
15. When unexpected demands arise or interruptions occur, I can easily evaluate their priorities against everything else I have to do.
