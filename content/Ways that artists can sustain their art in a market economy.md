1. Find a day job that allows you to engage with your art during after hours.
2. Find patronage.
3. Find ways to make money out of your art without sacrificing its integrity.
4. Voluntary poverty.

The practice of art is different in kind with the things we do for the money.

Artists must recognize that there is no clear fit of art in the market exchange economy. They have to relax a bit on that and have peace on that.

An ideal society for artists is a society who supports them financially and materially recognizing the essential nature of their work as somethintg outside the realms of the material economy.
