The usual outlining practice of starting with a topic and a theory or angle in mind is like waging a war. You have an angle, which you defend no matter what the cost. This is prone to cognitive biases ([[list of cognitive distortions]]). A better way of developing writing projects is to write bottom-up using permanent notes. The mindset you take when you do this is that of a scout which is interested to know the truth.
