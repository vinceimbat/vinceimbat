The word religion is commonly used in ordinary language today to refer to a group of people who engage in a set of social practices. This is actually the most critical change in the history of the concept of religion, which first happened when the word was used as a social genus that included Christian and non-Christian groups as species. A good example of this was Edward Herbert's (1583–1648) writings ([[Five elements of a religion per Herbert]]).

Religion as a social genus was used by European Christians in categorizing the cultures they encountered in their colonial ventures. As an example, see the work of Edward Burnett Tylor (1832–1917) ([[Religion is a belief in spiritual beings per Tylor]]).

The concept of religion as a social genus evolved to encompass, in order, theistic, polytheistic, then cosmic criterion. The cosmic criterion articulated by William James ([[Religion involves a belief in an unseen order per James]]) is now the most dominant.

> one can think of the growth of the social genus version of the concept religion as analogous to three concentric circles—from a theistic to a polytheistic and then to a cosmic (or “cosmographic” [Dubuisson 1998]) criterion. Given the near-automatic way that Buddhism is taken as a religion today, the cosmic version now seems to be the dominant one.
