A vision statement is an articulation of one's vision. The vision statement precedes the [[purpose statement]] and the [[mission statement]]. It describes what you want to see happen.

I like to write a vision statement in the present tense and integrate how I want [[my life areas]] to look like once all their standards have been established and maintained.

Here is [[my vision statement]].
