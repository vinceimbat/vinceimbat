Try to establish both formal and informal mentorships.

Some collaborators can be informal mentors by agreeing to check in with you on a regular basis. When meeting someone who can potentially be a mentor, send an email to them asking a simple question that you could use their input on.

A formal mentor is someone who agrees that you shadow them, apprentice with them, or meet once per month for a mentorship session.

When asking something from mentors, frame your ask in a way that shows the impact of your mentor's help.
