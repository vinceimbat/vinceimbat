Usually what appears to be apathy is actually exhaustion. With so many other concerns flooding my attention how can I possibly find the time to understand each glaringly important social issue that is important in their own right. Remember that there is some privilege attached to being able to study and understand each social issue let alone say one's opinion of it. So when I remain silent it isn't because I don't care. It's just because I care so much to the people who depend on me, to the causes I care greatly about, and to the things I want to create. I too understand the privilege that comes to making these choices. But part of being human is accepting that I couldn't do and pay attention to everything I want to.
