Anlong, Babaylan in training, 12

Caboloan (current day)

- He wants to know the truths about his past and the world he lives in
- But also wants to protect the freedom he was born in
- Ultimately, he wants to feel Inawa

Anlong has freedom but it's useless for him because he doesn't know anything beyond his family's island. His life is changed forever when a group of people reached his island. They bring with them truth about his past and a realization about himself: he possess rare talents to be a babaylan, a representative to the Pantelek.
