I want to be surrounded with people who support the life I want to live. I want to have mentors, peers, and an audience. I want to have an intimate circle of support. I want to have a philosophical group. I want to have a writing group. I want to be part of a scenius that both challenges me to expand my horizons and grounds me to the ultimate vision: **a friendship with wisdom to live a happy and meaningful life in community**.
