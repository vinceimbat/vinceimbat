The problem with associating oneself to an identity is that we become so attached to it that we become close-minded to other beliefs or mindsets that would have been beneficial to us.

For example, a freelancer could be so attached to the identity that he is unwilling to take a good job offer to a company even if the pay is good and the position promotes good work-balance just because it isn't freelancing! Worse, the freelancer could be so attached to his identity that he refuses to take the next step: becoming an entrepreneur.

A healthier mindset is to look at one's work life as an investment portfolio where all sources of income are allowed and viable. If taking on a job right now makes sense, include it in your portfolio and use that to remove stress and free you with the mental space and time needed to build your ideal business.
