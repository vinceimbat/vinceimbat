Writer's block is more of a technical than a psychological or a spiritual problem.

[[A writing practice and a note-writing system makes publishing easier]]. If you have a diligent writing practice, ideally every day, and you have a system to capture your thoughts (a journal is enough for most people), you should never run out of things to write about. What you wrote yesterday should be enough fodder for what you could write today (i.e., you can convert them into writing prompts you accumulate in your [[writing inbox]]).

Writer's block is almost non-existent among writers I know who have a disciplined writing practice and diligently use a note-writing system.
