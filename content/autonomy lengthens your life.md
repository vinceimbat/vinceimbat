[[freedom motivates us|Freedom motivates us]] and gives us a sense of control. This lengthens our lives. On the other hand, losing this sense of control makes us sick. [[freedom leads to ginhawa]] and [[Freedom is an essential prerequisite for optimal Ginhawa]]. In order to optimize Ginhawa and well-being, we need to optimize our sense of autonomy ([[Optimal Ginhawa can only be achieved in a context where individual freedom is optimized]]).
