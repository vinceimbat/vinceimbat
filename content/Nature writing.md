Literary
Written in the speculative personal voice
Nonfiction essay
Pastoral

[[Gilbert White]]

The kind of nature writing that I want to explore is one that is devoid of this desire to moralize and set ethical principles. This means I want to distance myself from the environmental movement, at least until I discover a personal reason for doing so.

I want to write what David Gessner "human writing that just happens to take place in nature" like [[thoughts/walden by thoreau]].

Nature writing reminds us 

Todo
- expound on the different angles in doing nature writing (pure description, poetry, personal essay)

	In critical practice, the term 'nature writing' has usually been reserved for a brand of nature representation that is deemed literary, written in the speculative personal voice, and presented in the form of the nonfiction essay. Such nature writing is frequently pastoral or romantic in its philosophical assumptions, tends to be modern or even ecological in its sensibility, and is often in service to an explicit or implicit preservationist agenda" ("Before Nature Writing," in _Beyond Nature Writing: Expanding the Boundaries of Ecocriticism_, ed. by K. Armbruster and K.R. Wallace, 2001).
