I like Maui's idea that her greatest purpose is to be a Buddha. To become someone, to achieve a particular identity. This is better than to desire to change the world, something outside oneself.

I couldn't control what will happen with the world. [[Focus on what you can control]]. But I know I could control how I could become a vessel of wisdom and compassion (hambal).
