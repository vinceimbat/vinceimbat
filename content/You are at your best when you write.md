It has been quite some time since I last published here in the blog. But I’m going back to publishing more in the following days after someone, a really special person, close to my heart said: “you are at your best when you write."

She’s right. Actually, I have not been myself in the past weeks since I stopped writing and publishing regularly. It’s like an inherent part of me - self-expression - was neglected and is asking so bad to be rejuvenated. True, writing and blogging has made me more intentional since I began and it has brought so many beautiful memories since I began.

Writing has always been the love of my life. My love affair with writing actually started with my love affair with books. Later on, I noticed that the two actually intertwined, as I grew more in love with reading books, I developed an unquenchable desire to create them myself. I’ve never published a physical book just yet but my writing grew better and better, and right now, more genuine and more intimate.

That was what become of my writing recently. Since I joined Dave Ursillo’s Literati Writers and took his free program “8 Tenets of Healthier Writing,” I felt my relationship with the written word changed - it became truer, more genuine, real, and intimate, like a best friend I never had. I decided to have a hiatus with publishing and instead wrote more for myself sharing some with a small group of passionate, kind, and uncritical people inside Dave’s community. I’m now journaling almost every day and practicing Dave’s writing philosophy of “pouring” or just letting the words come out without preconceive expectations. I like the philosophy. It’s like what the Bhagavad Gita is preaching:

>You have the right to work, but never to the fruit of work. You should never engage in action for the sake of reward, nor should you long for inaction. Perform work in this world, Arjuna, as a man established within himself – without selfish attachments, and alike in success and defeat. For yoga is perfect evenness of mind. (2:47–48)

Just write. Let it out. Let the words do their magic. Let the Divine within you pour the vessel out.
