Here is how to use the [[Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts]]:

1. Note the situation that triggered your negative emotions and thoughts.
2. Note the emotions felt after the event then rate them them between 1 (a trace) and 100 (most intense possible).
3. Note the automatic thought associated with the emotions.

Hereâ€™s an example of this method in practice:

In both the Triple-column Technique and the Daily Record of Dysfunctional Thoughts, one is required to write things down rather than just do the exercise in one's head. This is because [[writing facilitates thinking]] by forcing one to be more objective and allowing one to locate specific mental errors.
