Your reader expresses their identity through narratives. They also use these narratives to understand the world and their place in it, justify their decisions, and motivate themselves.

Identify what these narratives are then provide them to help your reader gain what they're looking for. By knowing the narratives they need, you will engage them more effectively and you will win their trust.
