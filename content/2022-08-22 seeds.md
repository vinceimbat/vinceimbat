How do you build a life work in philosophy outside academia while in the Philippines?

I still want to produce books, beautiful books inspired by philosophy, with poems, pictures, and narratives. For this, I think I need to build a network within the creative writing and photography spaces.
- Build a writing group.
- Collect connections and nurture these daily.

But then, I also need to nurture my analytical philosophy training.
- Build a reading group.

So the areas seem to be:
- learning
- living
- sharing
- connecting
- sustainability
