Outlining using the [[talahardin]] is not preparation or planning ([[planning is unsuitable for thinking]]). It is a separate task that needs to be done iteratively. This is because, as we work on individual [[evergreens]], the structural relationship betwen notes changes. Now, because, ideally, we [[combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice]] that happens daily, this means that this structural relationship between notes changes often.

We only realize the relationship between notes when we look at the big picture, say, when working on an index ([[start]]), [[structure notes]], or [[outline notes]]. However, this is most importantly experienced when we [[Write using permanent notes]], because this is where outlining often happens.

The key to outlining in Talahardin is to see the outline as “always preliminary.” We should not decide what to write in each chapter. Instead, decide what to leave of a specific part of a manuscript. We continue doing this until the structure stops changing that much and we can create a table of contents. But even so, we need to be open for it to change.
