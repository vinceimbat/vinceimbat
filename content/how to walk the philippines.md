(A manifesto to the Filipino walking arts.)

I propose a philosophy of walking that is as open as possible.

- Explore both urban and rural walks.
- Use walks for different ends.
- Explore both the literature of walking and the act of walking itself regardless of the literature it produces.
- Explore both short walks and long walks.
- Strengthen our understanding of the history of walking.
- Borrow walking models from both Western and Eastern sources.
- borrow ideas from our own culture.

What kind of walks will I avoid?
- The kind of walks we are already doing and are familiar with
- Walks that strengthen rather than challenge the status quo
- overly structured
- tourist walks
- Walks that strengthen the colonial gaze and disrupt communities (tourist walks could easily do this)
