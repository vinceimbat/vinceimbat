I have two archived newsletters both of which are now integrated in *The Long Walk*.

## Lilim

_Lilim_, which means "shade" or "shadow," used to be a bi-weekly newsletter about walking in Laguna, Pangasinan, and elsewhere in the Philippines. My walk narratives are now integrated with *The Long Walk* and are only published when available.

Read the archives [[tags/lilim|here]].

## Uman

_Uman_ means "change." It is a monthly newsletter sent every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.
