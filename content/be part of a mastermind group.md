There are three kinds of mastermind groups you can experiment with:
- One-on-one mastermind
- Small group mastermind
- Managed mastermind group

A one-on-one mastermind involves a regularly (say, weekly) meeting or phone call with a colleague. You spend one call to talk about your challenges then another call to talk about their challenges.

A small group mastermind is ideally made up of just four people. The meeting is best held for two hours. Each member will have one fourth of the time (20-30 minutes). At the beginning of the member's time, they will have to tell the group their specific challenger. The rest of their time will be spent brainstorming ways on how to help them navigate their situation.

A managed mastermind group could be large and consist of members from different creative fields. These groups are run entirely online using a group chat program. The members have access to chat and they can post updates 24/7. The group is moderated and managed by a leader who gives prompts, shares ideas, and encourage collaboration.
