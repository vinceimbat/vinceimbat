Cultivating [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]] involves [[thoughts/walking]] to explore and cultivate the terrain. Doing so, makes me closer to the terrain, makes me relate to it better. I understand the terrain in the context of "me" and how I react to it emotionally. I become a part of that reality rather than just an objective separate observer.

Once walked and the forest garden is culivated, I could open it up to other to walk to and explore. Visitors do their own excursions, creating their own meaning for the forest garden.
