To say that everyone who wants creative freedom needs to be an entrepreneur is wrong. There are creative works that are best done outside an entrepreneurship model. Some projects are best pursued in a context where the creative person's freedom is optimized and he doesn't have to think about money. These projects will benefit more with a [[patronage model]], where the creative produt and the creative person's earnings are loosely tied. An example of a creative pursuit that will benefit with this model is research ([[thoughts/a patronage model is best for an independent creative]]).
