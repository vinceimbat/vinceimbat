[[Feelings]], which are always conscious, and are the more cognitive manifestations of emotions, can also be philosophical.

They become philosophical when they deal with [[Universals]]

>If philosophy is, as its etymology indicates, the love of wisdom, then why would it be present in thought only and not in feelings?
>
>It should go without saying that love is a feeling—and wisdom is not a kind of thought so much as it is a thought-feeling, an alloy of the two. Wisdom is the result of the emotional saturation of thought and the intellectual saturation of feelings.
>
>The object of philosophical feelings is existence per se and such universals as “unity” and “multiplicity,” “freedom” and “necessity,” “life” and “reason,” “space” and “time.”
>
>The feeling of time being wasted because of inability to accomplish an action planned—that is just a feeling. But a melancholy about time, a feeling of inclusive transience or doom, a feeling that the inexorable order of things is destroying all that is familiar and beloved—that is a philosophical feeling.
>
>Other feelings too can be philosophical—pain, grief, tedium, delight, exultation—if they are experienced on behalf of humankind.
>
>The point is not that a feeling can become the object of philosophical contemplation but that a feeling can approach universality and become philosophical. To think about joy can be a philosophical enterprise, but so can the experience of joy, if the joy is related not to particular events but to a multitude of things and circumstances, to the world order in general, or to the fact of existence. I suggest calling universal feelings or philosophical sentiments of this kind unisentiments.
