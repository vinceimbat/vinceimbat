To do
- Write about walking before thunder and rain

Walking under thunder and cold wind
A rain about to come

The rain is my bride
I its bridegroom
I await its arrival
Not by waiting
But through a walk

Thunder
A bird cries
The train hoots from afar
Cicadas continue with what they do

Bugs take refuge under the streetlight whilst lightning and thunder abound.
