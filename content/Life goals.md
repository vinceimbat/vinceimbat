All of my life goals are listed comprehensively in [[lms/my life goals master list]]. I then track which goals to pursue yearly following the process in [[How to set goals]].

Here are lists of the goals I set for each year

- [[private/2020 Life Goals]]
- [[private/2021 Life Goals]]
- [[private/2022 Life Goals]]
- [[private/2023 life goals]]

To Do
- Update this note and connect it with [[goal-setting]].
- What needs to happen is improve the order of my life goals in my life goals masterlist. Free write first. Give yourself a lot of room to think and improve. Start with the core of my life: Creating and Understanding. What needs to happen in this year (or two) to really feel that I am doing what I am called to do. Then ask yourself what needs to be done in the other areas (overseeing, restoring, connecting, and sustaining) to support what I want to do with creating and understanding.
