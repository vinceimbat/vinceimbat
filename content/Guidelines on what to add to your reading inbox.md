When deciding what reading materials to add in my [[reading inbox]], I prioritize the following:

- Materials that are related to my goals
- Materials that could confirm my experiences
- Materials that are both interesting and dense with relevant information
- Materials that are time-tested (i.e., classics)
- Materials that survey a wide field or several fields (e.g., E.O. Wilsonâ€™s *Consilience*)
- Autobiographies or biographies that summarize entire lifetimes of lessons
	- This also help me see how authors I admire lived.

Having said that, you can still add materials to read just for fun as long as you [[decide whether to read for fun or for learning]] and read accordingly.
