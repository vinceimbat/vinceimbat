When deciding what to add reading materials to your [[Reading inbox]], prioritize the following:

- Materials that are related to your current goals
- Materials that are both interesting and dense with relevant information
- Materials that are time-tested (i.e., classics)
- Materials that survey a wide field or several fields (e.g., E.O. Wilsonâ€™s *Consilience*)
- Autobiographies or biographies that summarize entire lifetimes of lessons

Having said that, you can still add materials to read just for fun as long as you [[Decide whether to read for fun or for learning]] and read accordingly.
