For some reason, i suddenly missed talking with ordinary folk, the unlearned, unsophisticated.

Perhaps seeds should be captured through a small analog notebook because some insights need to be drawn.

The less I think about clients that better it will be for me and my art.

How do I simplify my life?
- Return to agency work.
- Limit volunteer work esp if not directly related to my life work.
- Consider no kids.
- No more extra pets.
- More walking and being in nature
- Focus on cultivating the most important relationships

I like the fact that there are many areas inside UPLB where interconnection suddenly vanishes. And coincidentally, these are the most silent places I love to frequent.
