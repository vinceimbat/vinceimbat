| What is happening                           | Interpretation                                                                                          | Emotion                    | Alternative Reasoning                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Lea is growing fatter.                      | She isn't practicing self-discipline.<br>  <br>She doesn't take into consideration the people she love. | Anger, annoyance           | Self-discipline isn't the only thing Lea needs to succeed. She needs a new environment. I am mind-reading when I tell her that she isn't considering the effects of her actions to her loved ones. She does. |
| Lea isn't able to save.                     | She doesn't think about the future.<br>  <br>She ignores me.                                            | Frustration, impatience    | Mind-reading. I don't know that. I believe she does think about these things probably more often than I assume. It's just that she has deeper habits to tackle.                                              |
| Lea shifts subjects when I share something. | She cares more of herself than me.                                                                      | Annoyance, feeling ignored | I am jumping to conclusions and mind-reading. I am not sure if my conclusion was correct. I need to ask her what's happening in her head when she does it.                                                   |
|                                             | I am spending my time in a less optimal relationship. I could be better somewhere else.                 | Jealous                    | I need to honestly weigh the negative things happening in this relationship vis a vis the positives. Only then can I avoid "generalizations" and mental filters.                                             |
