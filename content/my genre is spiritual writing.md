My main genre is spiritual writing. The spiritual writing happens in nature because of walking and because nature is such an emotional concept in an atheistic or non-theistic spirituality.

What does this spiritual writing look like?
- truth over beauty
- simple prose (or sentences)
- personal (but not too much)
- vulnerable
