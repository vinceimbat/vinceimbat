A spiritual calling necessitates that the [[diary]] or journal and, by extension, the [[talahardin]], which are all drafts, become my primary work as a writer. This is not to say that they have to be my public-facing works nor that I shouldn't write anything for the public; only that all my writing should begin with the intimate intention to clarify things for myself first before I even consider the needs of an audience.

Since my primary work as a writer is to fill up my journal, I should agree with [[paul wienpahl|Wienpahl]] when he said that writing cannot be forced (i.e., [[insight cannot be predetermined]]). I could show up each day, but what comes up, comes up. Usually, what comes up will be messyâ€”broken pieces, untouched pieces of a would-be collage. Therefore, publication is not and shouldn't be the ultimate goal. Publication should flow naturally from this process. Like all other actions, publication should respond to an existing need arriving from me or from the people and the world around me.
