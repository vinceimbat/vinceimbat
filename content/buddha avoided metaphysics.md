The Buddha actually avoided talking about doctrines of metaphysics because he knows that [[we agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology|we agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]], and this disagreement could clouds his main goalâ€”to teach how people can be kind to others and lessen the suffering in the world.

One of the metaphysical teachings he introduced but avoided expounding was the doctrine of the [[Non-self]].

Maybe, avoiding metaphysics is a sign of reverence and respect to questions that elude answers. Since I couldn't grasp my head around all of it, I bow to wonder and enjoy it. I focus on making the most out of the joy of what I know.

***
The question of [[how to live|how to live]] definitely cannot escape [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]] and [[thoughts/epistemology|epistemology]]. The question to be tackled is: Why should I care about others?

The concept of a bigger [[thoughts/self|self]], one that includes others, society, and even nature (see [[thoughts/imaoka creed of life meditations|Imaoka's Creed of Life meditations]]) answers this question this way: You need to care about others because they are part of yourself, and when you hurt others, you hurt yourself.

If this is indeed their argument, I notice that it is still grounded on the idea that man only takes care of himself and that he cannot love others that are not himself. In addition, he needs to rely on a metaphysical argument to persuade himself to take care of others.

But I believe that all human beings are capable of loving others outside of themselves. I can choose to show compassion to others. I don't need a metaphysical belief to realize this. All I need is practice (this is the difference between spirituality and philosophy). I believe that selflessness is possible.

# To do

- Expound on this claim using evidences from the ancient texts.
- Research how Buddhist scholars determine what the Buddha taught and said originally. Because if the doctrine of no-self is not his, then it is not his but his followers' teaching.
