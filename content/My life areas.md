I have six [[thoughts/life area]]s:
1. [[Overseeing]]
2. [[thoughts/understanding]]
3. [[Restoring]]
4. [[Connecting]]
5. [[Sustaining]]
6. [[thoughts/creating]]

Rather than clear silos that box projects, these life areas behave like tags. One project could be tagged with multiple life areas. This implies that a project could improve multiple life area standards simultaneously. To not be overwhelmed in maintaining my life's standards, I follow this advice: [[Live your life as if it was a walk]].
