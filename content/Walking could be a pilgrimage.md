The main goal of a pilgrim is be changed when he returns.

The pilgrim sees the path as transitory. Not a home but a way towards the real thing. Things that are met along the way as well as people are temporary.

Each walk can be a pilgrimage. To the things around, to the space, and most importantly to oneself.

When you walk, let your gaze touch as many things around you as you can. Breathe the air that is around you. And then walk and feel your feet or sandals touch the ground. This is the closest you can get to the space around you.
