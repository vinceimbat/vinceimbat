An [[thoughts/action]] becomes possible through a trifecta:
1. Consciousness ([[Purpose separates action from non-action]])
2. Time
3. Energy

Time and energy are physical resources ([[Action occurs in an external objective physical world]]) that are used up when we take action. One can make an argument that [[money]] is another resource. It is a resource, but we generate money through labor, which is also action that consumes time and energy. Also, when we make decisions in terms of managing money, we are still using time and energy.

This means that the question [[thoughts/how to live]] can be translated to "How do I want to spend my time and energy?" Now, we can make the argument that we can really not manage time because it is something external, and what we can manage is only energy. Therefore, life management is simply energy management.

To do
- Add insights from the book about managing energy not time.
