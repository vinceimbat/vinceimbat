- [[poems/kay liit]]

May humihila sa mamang
Hawak-hawak ang lubid
Di ma kita kung ano
Aso palang kay liit

Each walk can be a pilgrimage. To the things around, to the space, and most importantly to oneself.

When you walk, let your gaze touch as many things around you as you can. Breathe the air that is around you. And then walk and feel your feet or sandals touch the ground. This is the closest you can get to the space around you.
