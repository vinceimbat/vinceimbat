If grief was a walk
it would involve a lot of
going back
obsessive going back
that triggered by the feeling of
I haven't seen everything
I need to see it again.

Kung ang pagdadalamhati
ay paglalakad
ako'y mahuhumaling
sa pagpapabalik-balik
sa mga nalakarang
nagpapalalala sa lahat ng hindi pa nakikita
at lahat ng kailangang makita
muli

It is now more than ever that the question of community has to be tackled.
