The following are the arguments of eliminativism according to Chico the Philosurfer.

1. If a theory that posits the existence of an entity is superseded by a more advance theory, the existence of a thing should be let go.
2. The theory that the [[mind]] exists is folk theory superseded by neuroscience.
3. Therefore, the existence of the mind should be let go.

If you deny the existence of the mind, you deny the foundations of the proof of the existence of the brain. Because it is only through mind that we observe matter. Of course, the physicalist will argue that everything is reducible to matter and mind emerges from it. But that is so difficult to explain. How can bits and pieces of matter create a soul?
