1. Choose a dominant color.

Example:
Purple = royalty, wealth, success, & wisdom
Blue =  trust, security, stability, peace, and calmness

2. Add two more colors.

Use mycolor.space to find two colors using a dominant color.

Complementary
Accent

In design, black and white are also colors that have their own meaning.

3. Apply the 60/30/10 rule.

60 - probably background
30 - text
10 - accent (buttons, CTA)
