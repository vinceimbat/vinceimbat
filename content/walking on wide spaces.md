Seeing the wide night sky, clouds covering the overpowering mountain and the darkness continuing over the horizon, I couldn't stop but feel small and remember that kalawakan begins outside me. Or perhaps I am part of this one wide kalawakan. And this emotion that one only feels when embedded in place—wide spaces—I think is really important if only to remind us of our shared thrownness, our shared mystery of where we came from.
