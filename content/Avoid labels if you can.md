The problem starts when we take an ordinary mental phenomenon or activity, label it with something grander (more than a useful label). What happens is that it transforms the mental phenomenon into something intimidating and something divisive (this activity is better than that). This doesn't mean that this labels should never be used, only that they should be avoided if one can. Just call thinking, thinking, rather than philosophizing.

 Labels are just constructs that are invented for practical reasons. They are necessary myths, much like the “nation-state” is a necessary myth. They may or may not refer to existing phenomena.
