The return of my "spiritual" inclinations - exposure to Eastern thought.

After college, I started looking for a differeny way of working. I found blogging and read bloggers. One of them was [[Dave Ursillo]]. His writing really resonated to me and did something I didn't expect. He woke up my “spiritual” side.

Because Dave was a yogi and he shared some of his favorite books about yoga, I got acquainted first with [[Hinduism]]. With his suggestion, I read the [[Bhagavad Gita]], the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]], and [[The Heart of Yoga]] by Desikachar). I also met the works on [[Spiritual humanism]] by [[Jay Lakhani]]. Even at this point, I was still trying to connect secular knowledge with religious wisdom.

Through Dave’s suggestion, I also encountered and read the [[Tao Te Ching]].

I also started reading [[New Age]] philosophy.

I also started reading contemporary spiritual teachers like [[Eckhart Tolle]].

I devoured [[Nonduality]], [[Advaita Vedanta]], read [[Jeff Foster]]. I never really understood the teachings logically but I really felt good, felt like I found something in me that was always there. I saw that I don't have to be a radical and angry atheist like [[Richard Dawkins]] or the people at the [[Philippine Atheism, Agnosticism, and Secularism Incorporated (PATAS)]] to be truthful. I can be truthful and compassionate. I can have truth and beauty.

I tried doing meditation but still struggled. I was finally able to build a yoga plus meditation routine. I felt inner changes. I became less angry.

My exposure to Eastern thought made me a believer of [[Nonviolence]]. Not that I ever believed in violence. But I was given a logical reinforcement of what I know deep inside was true for me by a tradition that goes ages.

A natural extension of nonviolence is nonviolence on non-human beings. Thus my exposure to [[Economics]] and [[Environmentalism]].

To do

- This note is too long. First, go even more extensive in the events. Then, divide the note into smaller notes. For example, a note about what happened before Dave Ursillo, during Dave, then after Dave, then my exploration of Environmentalism.
