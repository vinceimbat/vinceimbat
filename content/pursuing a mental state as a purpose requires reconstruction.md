The method of reconstructing a [[mental state]] is simple: I just have to perform an [[action]] that allows me to experience it. The more I perform the action, the more I fulfill my [[purpose]]. [[Multiple kinds of actions can generate the same mental state]].

An action repeated this way becomes a [[inbox/Practice]] or a [[habits]]. While performing practices is the shortest way to experience a mental state, I can also [[Enhance the experience of a mental state by modifying the environment]]. However, this usually takes time.

To be accurate, what we mean by “reconstructing” a mental state is creating a “similar” mental state. Once over, [[A mental state cannot recur]] (i.e. “You cannot step on a river twice”).
