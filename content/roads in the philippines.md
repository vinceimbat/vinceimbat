Filipinos want cars because that idea is fed to them by roads. Government officials have vested interests in the car industry. Majority of tax money goes to public works, especially the rebuilding of roads.

Some people who can purchase cars loan them to people, who want to start Grab. Person 1 buys the car through a bank loan but names it to Person 2 (the buyer). The buyer then pays the new car in monthly installments with large interests that include the interest from the bank loan.
