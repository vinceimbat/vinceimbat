Perfect personal essays first (on nature, philo, personal life, place).

Experiment.

Write an essay exploring a philosophical question related to "how should we live".

Then use:
- field notes
- photographs
- personal memories
- place
- history

To explore the question.

The quest to answer how to live. That should be alive in my essays.
