There are three parts to my [[Annual review]] process:

1. Aggregate the annual report.
2. Perform the core of the annual review.
3. Write the annual review article and publish it

# Part I: Aggregate the annual report

1. Start the process on January 3 of the year (this is to give way for [[private/My monthly financial review process]] and the [[Monthly review]] first).
2. Copy and paste the summary of each monthly report ([[Monthly reports]]) into a new [[annual reports]]. Use the [[Annual report format]].
3. Use the annual report to accomplish the core of the annual review.

# Part II: Perform the core of the annual review

1. [[gratitude lists]]: Write a gratitude list.
2. [[past and coming year questions]]: Review your past year and think about the present year.
3. [[My life areas]]: Review areas of responsibility and set new standards if needed.
4. [[Life goals]]: Add new goals and corresponding projects. Refer to [[How to set goals]].
4. [[thoughts/personal narrative vision]]: Review last year’s personal narrative vision and write next year’s.
5. Routines and reviews: Review last year’s routines and update them if necessary. Re-evaluate the following:
	- [[My daily routine]]
	- [[Review]]
7. Share the results of your annual review to the people who are important to you: your partner, family, friends, and colleagues.

# Part III: Write the annual review article and publish it

1. Use the previous year's annual review article, your list of goals from the previous year, and your list of goals in the coming year to write a draft of the previous year’s [[annual review article]].
2. Edit.
3. Format as a blog post, publish, then share in social media.
4. Format it as a newsletter article then send it to email list.
