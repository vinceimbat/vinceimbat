Here along Pili Drive  
I sit on an immovable rock  
a rock as hard as my pelvis  
both sandwiching the thin fat and skin covering my bum  

Behind me  
a constant stream of vehicles  
vans, cars, motorcycles  
you name it  
all bound home to hundreds of families  

In front of me  
the smell of wet grass and mud  
conquer my nostrils, advance toward my lungs  
begging for more an aftertaste  
of shells, and tadpoles, and cricket eggs  

Speaking of which  
oh, the crickets  
tiny sirens under a see of grass  
alluring, consuming  
what is left of the soundscape  

A war  
between the sounds of Nature  
and the sounds of machines  
for which my ears and temporal lobe  
are the battleground  

I have no doubt  
you know who wins
