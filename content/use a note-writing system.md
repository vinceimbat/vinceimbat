You need a note-writing system like [[talahardin]] to keep track of the information you accumulate and to convert each piece of information into a lego block that you can use to develop insights and build publishable artifacts. There are many [[benefits of using a note-writing system]].

Without a permanent reservoir of ideas, you restrict yourself to the length of a project or to memory. If you believe in your ideas and you want to generate better insights, use a note-writing system.

# To do

- Literature note. Cultivate it to become a permanent note.
