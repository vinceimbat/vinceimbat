There are five categories of actions in the work that I do. These categories are:

1. [[thoughts/understanding]]
2. [[thoughts/living]]
3. [[Sharing]]
4. [[Connecting]]
5. [[Facilitating]]

The first four categories are sequential: one comes before the other. However, the fifth category (Connecting) is a meta-category that happens across all the steps.

Also, the first two categories are usually done in solitude. They make up the bulk of my work. I study during [[thoughts/my morning writing practice]] and practice throughout other blocks of time within [[My daily routine]]. On the other hand, the last three categories involve other people and are done less frequently, except Connecting, which ideally should be a daily practice ([[Strategy for Connecting]]).

The five categories of action does not just express what I want from my work, [[The five categories of action in my work express what I want from life]]. Furtheremore, these categories are designed to answer the question [[thoughts/how to live]]

To do
- Living is no longer a category. Everything I do is living.
