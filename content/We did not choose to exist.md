A lot of times, I feel like a clueless lost foreigner no castaway in this world and I didn't even have a say about it. I didn't choose my existence. I know some supernaturalists would say they chose their existence even before they became human, but even if that is true, it couldn't escape the infinite regress that is did you also chose the existence of that which chose your existence? And so on.
