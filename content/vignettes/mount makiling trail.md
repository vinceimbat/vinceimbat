The clouds above me were moving so fast I had to stop to watch them. I raised my head and my eyes followed their gray outlines. Where are they going and why do they hurry?

At the mouth of the trail, cracking sounds subtly break the silence I've only just found. They seem to come from above. It was the sound of broken woodâ€”branches yielding to the November wind. An entire branch, longer than both my arms combined, fell on the spot I just walked on. I move to the middle of the road and stood still to listen to the cracking and watch for more branches falling in front of my.
