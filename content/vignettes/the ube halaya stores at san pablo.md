When you enter San Pablo, before the city proper, there is a very long stretch of ube halaya vendors. Almost everyone is the same. They painted their stores in violet. The only way to standout is to make a really good product, and perhaps change your branding. There are  some stores that are not colored violet.

The stores are selling a secondary product: tikew. The number of stores beats the kind of competition present in Los Ba√±os among pasalubong stores. There are possibly 40 to 50 stores selling the same product to the point tha they have to create a "mag-uube" association perhaps to control pricing etc.

There are also lots of old dilapidated buildings. Not old vintage buildings but modern-looking buildings that were just abandoned.
