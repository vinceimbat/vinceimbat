The only storefronts truly open in LB on Christmas eve are the fruit stalls. Watermelon, apples, oranges, and grapes. All things round abound at this time of the year. But some fruits you shouldn't see make their appearances: papaya and mango.

The craft shops are surprisingly open. Perhaps, they cater to those in need of last-minute gift wraps. And, of course, a few cafes, which, however, are closing early around 8 pm. Some restaurants are waiting for those people like us who would rather spend noche buena outside than indoors or those, like us, away from families, away from loved ones whose hands would usually prepare the food that binds all of us.

The new Korean restaurant is still empty save for the waitress who seems to also be the cashier manning the front desk and the two Korean couples sitting on one of the tables—the owners perhaps—conversing about seemingly serious matters. The place is in sharp contrast with Thai Kitchen, which seems already half full based on what little we see through its glass door.

The Italian restaurant, which seems always empty anyway, is still empty, prompting me to think why it still remains when many of the better, more popular places have closed in recent years.

Walking around LB at this time of the year, one could be completely surprised that many if not most houses are filled with silence. One would think that these houses, which are often silent already during most of the year, will now be peopled, burst in laughter, chatter, or singing. But no. Christmas lights and lanterns blink and brighten on the gardens, but no one, not a party is happening inside the houses. What really comes to life are the shacks of Arayat Street, the houses of the often see walking at Mt. Data Street and a few apartments.
