This is how I choose fonts for any design project.

**Step 1.** I define the purpose of the project, which provides the constraints that help with my decision making. Questions useful to ask at this stage are:
- Does a client have an existing brand guide?
- Does a client have an existing choice of fonts?
- Do you want people to read chunks of text?
- Do you want people to read a few text?
- Do you want to draw attention to one word?
- Do you want to establish trust?
- Do you want to establish a bold and edgy vibe that disrupts the industry sector?

**Step 2.** I'll look for a base font. Based on the purpose of the project, I decide whether I'll be using serif or sans serif.

**Step 3.** I then decide whether to use classic fonts or new fonts. This decision will be based on the purpose of the project.

For classic fonts, I search the following resources:
- [[go-to fonts of Vignelli]]
- https://blog.spoongraphics.co.uk/articles/25-classic-fonts-that-will-last-a-whole-design-career

Good classic fonts:
- Akzidenz Grotesk
- Avenir
- Futura
- Gill Sans
- Mrs Eaves
- Myriad
- Avant Garde
- Minion
- Sabon
- 

For new fonts:

- [MyFonts](https://www.myfonts.com/)

**Step 4.** I choose a second font to pair with the base font. Usually, I would pair serif with sans serif to create enough contrast and keep the reader engaged.

**Step 5.** If necessary, I look for a third font, which serves as the accent. The accent could be a script font to be used for pubmats.

**Step 6.** If I'm not sold with the current pairings, I'll come up with a new one, or several new ones, following the previous steps, to create options to choose from. I could also look for instant inspirations from the following:
- Pinterest
- Envato
- Canva
- Creative Market

**Step 7.** Once I've decided on a pairing, I would create font mock ups by combining it with colors and design elements to test whether the pairing works with other elements of the brand.

As I deepen in my design practice, I accumulate a collection of [[my go-to fonts]], which I find useful when working with a project or with clients who are starting from scratch. This collection contains some go-to fonts for header, body, and accent.
