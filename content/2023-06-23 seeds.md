- [[poems/dead frog]]

Mahinang ulan kanina

Fog on the horizon

These moments are rare. Must be here when they happen.

Saw a cow like Lulu. I have forgotten how to stare at a cow.

The sun has consumed the frogs inards. The wheel of my bike kisses the frog's black skin and spurts whatever liquid is left inside.

All around me, the sikling sings.
