This is a list of the best books I've read while researching for answers on the question "How to live?"

I have only included books that I have spent many hours reading, digesting, and whose advice I have applied in my own life and work. All of these books have influenced how I understand reality, how I develop practices, and how I pursue my purpose and the work that I do.

I also keep a [list](https://vinceimbat.com/reading/) of all the books I have read in the last couple of years.
