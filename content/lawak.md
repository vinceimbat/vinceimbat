# Quest

To formalize doing the work I'm called to do in front of an audience: To understand the universe through walking.

Ang mabatid ang sansinukob sa pamamagitan ng paglalakad.

Say naamtaay uniberso diya'd panamegley na pan-akar.

I follow this purpose to say yes or no to opportunities.

batid - kilala ang pag-iral ng isang tao, pook, o bagay sa pamamagitan ng paningin, karanasan, o ulat

Possibly more specific
- To create text and images brought about by walking.

## Principles

Lawak projects are done and give birth to creations that follow the following principles.

## Independent

I want to work with no gatekeeping because I want to write about topics that I want to write about. Therefore, much of the work I produce is high-quality self-published material.

## Subsistent

These projects require little to no financing. If there is any need for funding, the money comes from my own pocket or from the generous support of my community

- Lean
- Bootstrapped
- Self-sustaining

## Communal

While some walking projects require solitude, the creations that come from these projects are meant to be shared with a community, for free or supported by little means. They are meant to build real connections. Some walking projects will also involve groups.

## Freedom

Most of my work will be released for free.
