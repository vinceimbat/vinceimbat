Around me is the defeaning sound of cicadas.

Two birds cross the creek below me.  I look down from the bridge at Ela. They crossed, arrived at the other bank full of stones, separated for a while, but moved as if simultaneously coordinated. Then they got back together. Walked some more and gone under the shades of the banana leaves. The church bell nearby rang and a teal kingfisher flew by.

Look for the river and its creeks. These are potential pilgrimage spots.
