The things you didn't experience, make you different.
- family: i didnt have parents who really talked to me or asked about my inner life (dreams, thoughts, passions), and yet despite this, I managed to have a decently vibrant inner life. But i have very little need for validation and some people are amazed by this. I see it as an advantage. Nothing could stop me but myself.

Cosmic perspective

Where do you start with a contemplative life?

There is no original contemplative life. Look for examples.

Meditation does not require silence. You can still be aware of the workings of the mind in someone's speech.

Poetry can be used to create silence.
