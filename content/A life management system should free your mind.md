The only worthy goal of building a [[thoughts/life management system]] is to free one's mind. Ideally, one day, when all the most important areas of life are efficiently managed, one can spend more time in the present moment, enjoying and resting.

A life system evolves and grows in complexity in time. But it doesn't have to be mature before it can provide freedom.

With some upfront effort, one can build a [[Minimum viable life management system]] that enables one to be more free and present as soon as possible.

Moving forward, this minimum viable life system can be maintained or improved. However, doing so should not interfere with the freedom and presence that the system has already achieved.
