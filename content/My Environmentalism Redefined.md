I still feel the inner call by the experience of Nature.

But I am comfortable of just seeing this as a very intimate subjective experience.

I am not quick to conclude that it is something that everyone should hold.

My philosophizing is bringing me back to the artist within.

The artist that was always there.

My desire is to design my life so that I could savor more experiences like these. Because they are the point of it all. Not accolades.

The personal subjective experience.

My preferences definitely have bearings on my social choices but I will never make the mistake of prescribing them.

They are too personal, thus sacred, for that.
