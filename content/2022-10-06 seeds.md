- [[poems/never-ending - a poem for gyra]]

If Gy walked on the never-ending bridge
On that summer night
She might still be here with us
And yet
She walked
Not on the bridge
But on that godforsaken bus

I wonder
How often did Gy looked up
At the moon
To see it as if for the last time
I hope she did so
As often as she can.

Did she giggled too
On this benches
Surrounded with friends
As she imitates

Or did she
Followed her solitude sometimes

If Gy walked on this never-ending bridge
Who knows
She might still be here

But everything eventually ends
The sun
The stars
The universe

This bridge
This bridge
Shall too end
And everything vanishes
Into myth

I read how the word "generous" is used. For example, in the intro to lyric philo article, the author used "a generous definition" to refer to Zwicky's definition of philosophy.

We have a bias towards what is avant garde. We scroll down from the newest to the oldest. But following someone esle's footprints always starts at the oldest print.
