"Let no one think it is an easy way because it is concerned with moments of happiness rather than with stern duty or high moral endeavour. For what is really easy, as I found, is to blind oneâ€™s eyes to what one really likes, to drift into accepting one's wants ready-made from other people, and to evade the continual day to day sifting of values."

~ Marion Milner
