Convert your written mission statement into a spoken version and use it in casual conversations to test it until it no longer sounds weird. See how this feels to say it out loud to another person. Note where you lose them—where they don’t understand, where it falls flat, and what their follow-up questions are. Use this to hone the language of your mission statement so that it is not only clear to you, but clear to others.
