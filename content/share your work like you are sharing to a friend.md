Sharing your work should feel as natural as conversing with a close friend. This means avoiding things that make you look distant and overly professional, such as writing in the third person.

Be as vulnerable as you can. Share your process, motivations, and roadblocks. Share the complete reality of your life, not just the good things. Be enthusiastic about other people's work as well.
