This is a modified version of the [[Permanent Portfolio]]. It was designed by Tyler at [[Portfolio Charts]]. Here is its asset allocation:

- 20% Total US Stock Market
- 20% US Small Cap Value
- 20% Long-Term Treasury Bonds
- 20% Short-Term Treasury Bonds
- 20% Gold

According to [[John Tyler Williamson]] of [[Optimized Portfolio]], the problem with this potfolio is that it is heavy in US stocks and it uses gold. He shares a [[Modified Golden Butterfly portfolio with no gold]], which also uses international ETFs for more diversification.
