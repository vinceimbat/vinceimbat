## [[tags/uman|Uman]] (monthly) — January 2022 to present (15 issues)

*Uman* is the Pangasinan word for change. I started it to keep track of the monlthy "changes" I undergo in my projects, studies, and goals but it became this exercise in essay writing that weaves spirituality, walking, writing, and photography.

## [[tags/tlw|The Long Walk]] (weekly) — October 2022 to present (27 issues)

A weekly newsletter that used to share artifacts I find during my walks in geographic space and in the wilderness of the mind. Now I use it to share new essays, poems, short notes, and photographs all inspired by walking.

# Archived Newsletters

## [[tall tales 1|Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1]]   — January 15 to 21, 2024 (5 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk of Baguio City. In this newsletter, I wrote about how I returned to streets and places I used to frequent as a formed minister of the Jehovah's Witnesses.

## Roots ྾ Gravel — December 4 to 10, 2023 (8 issues)

A pop-up newsletter for my first week-long walk around Los Baños. The original intention of the walk was to explore a free, creative, and subsistent spirituality through walking around my current town of residence. The essays and photographs diverted from this original intention as the walk progressed.

## [[tags/lilim|Lilim]] (weekly) — May 2021 to August 2022 (32 issues)

*Lilim* is a Filipino word that means shade. It was a weekly newsletter that ran for three seasons during the pandemic. It began as a documentation of my early walks in Los Baños and evolved into a predecessor of The Long Walk.
