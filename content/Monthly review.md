While the [[Weekly review]] is designed to maintain my [[ground level]] ([[My LMS ground level setup]]), the monthly review breaks this continuous focus on taking [[thoughts/action]] and provides a space where I can evaluate my [[Sky level]], most especially [[My life areas]] and [[Life goals]]. If this is its purpose, a seeming disconnect between what I do and what I would like to do is caused by a problem in my monthly review process. This is why I think reading my [[Purpose statement]], [[My mission statement]], etc. is necessary during [[lms/my monthly review routine]].

Another key difference between a weekly review and a monthly review is that a weekly review can be mostly tactical because the monthly review has already been strategic. If the weekly review helps me get things done, the monthly review ensures that I get the “right” things done. A monthly review assures that I maintain focus on my intentions ([[Focus is the force you exert to stay in line with your intentions]]). Furtheremore, it reminds me of my progress.

There are two artificats produced by a monthly review: the [[lms/monthly reports]] and [[Uman]].
