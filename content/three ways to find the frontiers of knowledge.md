According to [[Samo Burja]], to find the frontiers of knowledge, I need to:

1. Find a mentor
2. Find a culture of practice
3. Find a functional institution

Is there a culture of practice that I can join? If yes, what?

What are the characteristics of a mentor that I need?

Is there an functional institution that I can put myself in? If yes, what institution?
