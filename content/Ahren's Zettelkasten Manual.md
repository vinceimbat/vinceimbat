Here are the steps that make up the [[thoughts/zettelkasten]] workflow presented by [[thoughts/sonke ahrens]] in his book [[_notes/02 Talahardin/How to Take Smart Notes - Ahrens]].

1. **Write fleeting notes.** You can also write [[thoughts/evergreens]] directly to the Zettelkasten.
2. **Write literature notes.** When reading, take notes about what can help you write original permanent notes. Be short and selective, particularly with quotes. Keep literature notes with their bibliographic details in your [[Reference system]].
3. **Write permanent notes.** Once a day, review your [[Fleeting notes]] and [[literature notes]]. Think about how these relate to your own thinking. Use the following questions:
   - Does the new information contradict, correct, support, or add to what you have in your Zettelkasten?
   - Can you combine ideas to generate something new?
   - What new questions arise?

   Write these notes for your future self:

   - Write one idea per note.
   - Use full sentences.
   - Indicate your references.
   - Be brief and clear.

   After processing the fleeting notes, throw them away. After processing literature notes, return them to your reference system.

1. **Add links.** In each new permanent note, add links to related notes, to the index, or to an entry point linked to the index.

To write using the zettelkasten, see [[Write using permanent notes]].
