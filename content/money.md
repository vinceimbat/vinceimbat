The greatest bondage of our time is our bondage with the money economy. It is the 21st century slavery. There was a time in the history of humanity, where human beings only worked enought time to provide for their food, shelter, and clothing. Things were simple and time was abundant. Today, the world is complex. Our [[ends]] are complex and interconnected to a larger behemoth. How we act, what we do, and when we do itâ€”these constitute [[Freedom]] and they are what we lost through the rat race.

How do we get off the rat race? Is it through accumulating material wealth so we can but all the non-material wealth we need?

Here, again, is the dichotomy: Could we generate happiness from within alone, or should we get the instruments out of us?
