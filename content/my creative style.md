I want my work to execute the following:
1. Framework: Move between these three realms: cosmic–local–personal (ala [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau]]; see [[micro then macro]]). 
2. Inventiveness and poetry (ala [[annie dillard|Dillard]])
3. Simplicity of language (ala [[ben hewitt|Ben Hewitt]] and [[rofel brion|Rofel Brion]])
4. Short vignettes with some photographs (ala [[craig mod|Craig Mod]])
5. Have a surface-level element that it was written outdoors.
6. Reflects a genuine and earnest desire to know and understand—not to perform.
7. [[my work is religious in nature|My work is religious in nature]].
