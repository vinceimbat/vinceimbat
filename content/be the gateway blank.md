# Focus on audience experience and personal fulfillment

Focus you efforts in:
- understanding your reader and the experience they are looking for
- creating work that generates that experience
- creating work in a way that feels right

Let go of:
- objects (publications)
- tokens (awards, workshops)
- metrics (followers, sales, etc.)

The real value of your work depends on its ability to produce meaningful reader experience.

If you focus on reader experience, you can immediately help someone and you'll be successful more easily.

# Signs that you have focused on audience experience

- You can remember the names and faces of your readers.
- You can remember moments you had with your readers.
- It feels like your work is a way for others to see the world differently and not just a product.
- You receive feedback that you work influenced or even shaped the lives of your readers.

# Public milestones are deceptive

Objects, tokens, and metrics shouldn't be your goal. Treat these as side effects of you doing the real work of learning about your audience, creating the best experiences for them, and building lasting relationships with them.

Public milestones are deceptive. They mask the true impact of your work, and they make you think that once you've achieved them your work becomes easier. It doesn't.

If you overvalue public milestones, they could even lead to impostor syndrome (feeling like a fraud and being pressured to live up to others' expectations). To avoid this, focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment.

# Focus on one-on-one engagement

Seek validation in reaching one person and engaging with them deeply. Focus on one person at a time. Begin to do this long before you even create or launch your work. If you already have an audience in front of you, start with them.

This could change the momentum of your creative life.

Your task is to:
1. Learn where your people hang out
2. Learn what they need
3. Learn what they love
4. Learn how they want to engage
5. Learn how they relate to your creative work (or existing things similar to yours)
6. Engage with them directly one by one

What does engagement look like?
1. Seek out small conversations
2. Perform tiny ways of helping
3. Have meaningful conversations
4. Share
5. Show empathy

Develop your own practices and routines to reach out to members of your audience.

# Focusing on audience experience and personal fulfillment makes success more accessible

You may need to spend years to perfect your craft, but when you focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment, you immediately succeed. Establish daily and regular practices and routines to nurture your relationship with your audience one by one. See your writing as a form of ministry.

# Share your process and journey as it happens

Sharing your process and journey is how you tell others to follow a path that leads to your gateway, which is what people seek.

Here are the benefits of sharing your process:
- It makes people feel that they are part of your process.
- It builds advocates connected to your work in a personal way that will help spread your work.
- It makes you aware of how your daily life aligns to your creative work, holding you accountable.

# Things to share from your process and journey

To know what to share, you must relate your story with what your readers need.

Here are a few things you can share:
- experiences (as connected to your creative work)
- conversations (as connected to your creative work)
- curiosities
- how you are developing your skills
- how you are relishing moments where you feel inspired
- how your work matters to you and how it can connect to what your reader cares about
- behind the scenes of how you do your work
- materials you use
- milestones
- educate them on the elements that makes incredible work
- what drives you on a deeper level

# Your gateway is how your audience experience a worldview

Your gateway should always be anchored by a belief system, worldview, or a way of being in the world. Building your gateway involves exploring the deeper themes behind this worldview that drives you and engages your ideal reader.

Your gateway should become the voice that articulates your reader's story to the world.

# A gateway consists a story, creator, and topics

To build a gateway, you must do the following:
1. Craft a compelling story.
2. Use your self to help your reader experience a larger topic.
3. Write narratives that flow from your story.

# Extend a book using new content

When you already have a book, do not market it by sharing excerpts of it in your social media, blog, or newsletter. Instead, write new content, new stories that extend the book.

# Use your gateway to help your audience build their identity

Identity is what your reader want the most. Using your gateway, help your reader define or clarify their identity (or an aspect of it) so they can open their authentic self more to the world. Facilitate how your reader could find something deep within them that they could use to make sense of their world and their place in it.

# A gateway where author meets audience is always present

Even in works where a gateway is not intentionally built, it is still there.

# Use your gateway to shape how your audience accept your works

Since a gateway is always present, it is better to shape it intentionally so you can shape how readers see your work.

# Help your audience build an identity using narratives

Your reader expresses their identity through narratives. They also use these narratives to understand the world and their place in it, justify their decisions, and motivate themselves.

Identify what these narratives are then provide them to help your reader gain what they're looking for. By knowing the narratives they need, you will engage them more effectively and you will win their trust.

# A gateway is where the author's and reader's narratives converge

Your creative works is a bridge between your narrative and the narrative of your reader. Establish your narrative (including what you stand for) and share it in a way that speaks to your reader.

# Your values, practices, and passions tell your narratives

Identify what matters most in your life (not just in creating). These are:
- things you pour your time, energy, and money into;
- things you would fight for;
- things you would put your time and energy every day, week, and month; and
- things you wouldn't give up.

Only pursue projects that are a core part of what matters most in your life (not just in addition to them). Because you believe in what matters most in your life, you will also believe more in your projects regardless of external validation from the marketplace and public milestones.

Along with these values are the practices that express them. Both inform the narratives you tell and that connects you with your reader.

The topics you could talk about nonstop and the people you enjoy being around also tell your narratives.

# Spend time on the things you want to be known for

You can only convince people to make time for your creative vision if you make time to create it.

# How to craft a mission statement for your writing

Write a simple sentence that 
1. Articulates something you believe strongly in.
2. Articulates the experience you want your writing to create for others. 

Your reader's experience should describe transformation, i.e., how a reader changed months after reading your book. You can use the following questions to think about this:
- What do you want them to think quietly in their heads about the world you have opened for them?
- How does it relate to their life, their identity, their interactions?

Try to be as clear and as unshakeable as possible.

# How to write an effective bio

Your bio is the centerpiece of the narrative that connects the work you create and who you are. Your bio should embody not just a chronological view of your life, but the narratives that fuel you.

Principles
- Start at the present then work yourself backwards.
- Start with what's most important to the reader, not yourself.

To write a bio, follow these steps:

1. Write a belief statement that your ideal reader would read and say “YES! This!”
	1. This statement is a version of your mission statement.
	2. It could express any of the following:
		1. what you are fighting for
		2. what you are fighting against
		3. a feeling that you want people to have when they experience your work
		4. a story that is shorthand for what your audience wants to align with.
2. Write a description of your creative work.
	1. Don't share everything. Just pick the most important parts of your creative work right now.
	2. Don't present a chronology of your creative work.
3. Share your credentials as they relate to your creative work.
	1. These credentials could be public milestones.
	2. But they can also take the form of a story on how you got into your craft or why it matters to you.
4. Share your background and experience filtered through your creative work.
5. Share personal details. Share your hobbies, your hometown, and your background. Only after you've hooked your reader with the narratives that they care about will you share this.

# Make honing your gateway a habit

Treat your gateway like you treat your craft. Improve it regularly as if a habit. Use experimentation, observation, and getting feedback to improve it.

# Hone your gateway by doing creative work each week

You can also improve your gateway by doing your creative work itself and sharing it regularly. The artifact you produce during this weekly practice is not a product that you sell. It is a way to connect with your reader through your stories and knowledge.

# Hone your mission statement by using it in conversations

Convert your written mission statement into a spoken version and use it in casual conversations to test it until it no longer sounds weird. See how this feels to say it out loud to another person. Note where you lose them—where they don’t understand, where it falls flat, and what their follow-up questions are. Use this to hone the language of your mission statement so that it is not only clear to you, but clear to others.

# Prepare for bad days

When you lose faith and clarity in your own vision and work, prepare a “reset” that reminds you of why you create. Your reset could include the following:
- a quote from your hero
- a photo that sparks your imagination on what is possible
- a biography or documentary about someone who inspires you, or
- a song that centers you.

Here are other ideas you can do to encourage you:
- Use daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly reviews to write your progress.
- Recognize and honor your accomplishments no matter how small by writing them down every day.
- Have an “emergency call” list of three people who motivate you. These should be individuals you trust, who believe in the possibility of what you want to create, and would take your call without judgment.

# Aspire for sustainability

Your priority is not wild success. Your priority is to continue sharing your voice and your vision with new work for as many years as possible. Your priority is for your work to change the lives of others for the better over the long run.

If this sustainability built by slow organic growth gives you more chances of serendipitous luck, then good. If not, it isn'y your priority any way.

# Find your audience and bring them into you gateway

Since your goal is to have your work impact your reader's life, you have to bring them there. To do this, you have to open your gateway, find your people, learn where they hangout, and know what resonates with them. With this knowledge you can craft messages that could bring them to your gateway.

# Universal skills to find your audience

Funnel your reader into a five step universal process.

1. Awareness - Let your reader know you exist.
2. Consideration - Help your reader consider you as a viable option.
3. Conversion - Help your reader choose you.
4. Loyalty - Nurture your reader's loyalty by giving them what they need.
5. Advocacy - Help your reader advocate your work.

The top—the widest part of the inverted pyramid—represents the broadest possible message to the largest group of people. Each step down the funnel slowly leads those who are most interested in what you have to offer to deeper levels of engagement with you and your work.

# Nurture advocates

For your creative work to grow, you have to envision a sale as just one milestone in a much bigger process, one where people who buy from you tell others about your work. Aspire to build a readership of loyal advocates.

# Really know your audience

For your creative work to be meaningful for both you and your reader, you have to know them really well. Find and explore the path that your reader already walks along every day. Have empathy for who they are, what they already know, their habits, their interests, and who they trust. This involves spending adequate time directly with your reader. Then, use this knowledge to determine where you need to put your efforts and better serve your reader. Be willing to make adjustments to ensure you are truly engaging your reader.

Avoid assuming that your work has intrinsic value, especially when you are unable to make that intrinsic value clear. Help others appreciate your work by considering their needs and values.

# Position your gateway where your audience already walks

Position your gateway where your reader already loves to hang out. This involves using social media platforms they already use or hanging out at groups they are a part of.

# Use words your audience is already using

Use words understood by your reader and that engage them.

# Perform direct primary research

Direct primary research means you can put names and faces to your readers because you have engaged with them directly.

This could involve developing colleagues, who are people doing similar work in your field and who can connect your work to an existing audience.

While talking directly with your audience, probe:
- what your ideal audience cares about,
- where they hang out online and in person,
- what other creative work they love and why, and
- who they admire and listen to.

Design each reader outreach as a meaningful event, where you learn something new about your audience when you do it and it fuels a deep sense of momentum.

# How to find your ideal audience

Landmarks or comps are creative works or platforms that are examples of the creative work you aspire to create and that your reader universally know are the best examples of the kind of work you want to do. 

Use existing landmarks to understand what your potential reader already likes, how they would describe works similar to yours, and what
the marketplace where your creative work will exist looks like. Since your potential audience already gravitated toward these landmarks, use to find them. Then turn the same landmarks into guideposts (i.e., using a guest post or comments) to guide your ideal audience to your gateway.

In creating guideposts, focus on the positive emotions people feel about similar work already, and redirect those emotions and attention to your own creations.

# How to find comps

To begin, find five comps. These comps should have the following characteristics:
- released within the past one to five years
- have some level of public validation, such as reviews
- are within the same field as the one where you create

Follow the following process to find these comps

## 1. Begin with landmarks

Start with the big prominent names in your field—the people who everyone knows. Go to the marketplaces where this work is shared or sold. For books online, go to Amazon or Goodreads. For physical books, go to libraries or bookstores. Find landmarks in your field whose work you feel has some relation to yours. Take note of how the marketplace categorizes works such as yours.

## 2. Find guideposts

Find people who have found some success but haven’t had massive breakout hits.

To find guideposts in Amazon:
1. Go into Amazon and type in the names of the authors you have identified are landmarks.
2. Scroll down to the “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought” section and click on each book.
3. Keep scrolling to see all of the books Amazon displays here. Amazon provides similar features that may be useful, such as “What Other Items Do Customers Buy After Viewing This Item?”, “Frequently Bought Together”, and even “Sponsored Products Related To This Item.”
4. Look for those that were published within the past five years, which have some reviews (at least twenty), and most importantly, that you feel resonate with the work you create in some way.
5. Write down the names of the books and authors whose work resembles yours in some way; note why that is the case.
6. Seek out other authors who write in the same topic or genre as you do. Show up to their events, email them, support their work. Be curious about their readers. Ask them questions about what they love and why.

## 3. Obsess about the voice of the reader

If you already have an existing audience, you have to talk directly to at least five of them and ask them questions that would help you better serve them.

Alternatively, you can do research by reading the reviews your comps got in Amazon. When doing your research, be mindful of the following:
- Note what readers liked about the book.
- Note what they didn’t like and why.
- Pay very close attention to the language they use. Look for trends in terms of phrases or focus.
- For each of the comps you find, identify how others categorize them. You can look at the Amazon category rankings
- Review how the artist describes their work. Look for phrases that resonate.
- Look for mentions of these comps anywhere you can find it—blogs, podcasts, within major media, and well outside of it.
- When seeking examples to help guide you, the question you want to ask yourself is, “Who is doing work that matters and is succeeding at it?”

If you want to get deeper, you can perform individual Google searches on each comp you find. The challenge here is to get as deep as you can and to challenge your assumptions.

# Befriend people who have experience in your field

Befriend people who have already engaged an audience similar to the one you want for your work. These are people who have deep experience within your field.

# Focus on establishing relationship with mid-level doers

Mid-level doers should be your priority because they are successful but still accessible. Find them in both formal and informal media. To look for them, ask these questions:
- Who shows up to conferences or events, workshops, and online chats?
- Whom does your ideal audience already know and respect in their field?

A particularly good place to find mid-level doers is podcasts in your field. The podcaster themselves is someone you should focus on. The list of people interviewed is a great place to begin in identifying additional mid-level doers.

# See other creators as collaborators not competitors

While creative work always has a tendency to be competitive, it is best to favor and maintain a sense of collaboration in everything you do. Other creators could help hasten your progress, so instead of feeling jealous of them, overwhelm them with kindness.

# Use social media for research

Here is a short guide to using social media as a research tool.

1. Set yourself a wee or two to do your research.
2. Remember to just listen and let go of your assumptions and your own narratives.
3. Notice which channels are more popular in your creative field and make a note of it.
4. Identify the one or two social media platforms where your mid-level doers are most active on and have the most followers then follow them there.
5. After following them, loot at every social media update they share.
6. Recognize the practices that work for those in your field.
7. See who your mid-level doers follow and who they mention often in their social media feeds.
8. See who follows these mid-level doers and who mentions them by searching their @name in the search field for each social network.

When applying what you learn, use a wide range of communication channels and methods as you can.

# Meet people in person and ask questions

Another great way to learn about your readers is to attend events they go to.

Here are some pointers to remember while in these events:
- Focus your attention on the attendees. Talk to them.
- Ask people why they came.
- Ask about what kind of work they love and why.
- Ask how they got into this field.
- Don’t try to impress people, and don’t try to sound too smart or savvy.
- Whatever you do, don’t promote your own work.
- Consider reaching out to those mid-level doers you identified. Ask simple questions that you need help with.

# Look at organizations in your field as made up of people

If there are brands or media that you feel your audience knows and respects, don't think of them as publicity channels for your work. Look at them as people with a shared passion. Stop pitching blindly to “entities” and start understanding these organizations as real groups of multifaceted people, who are just like you.

To do this, here are a few pointers:
- Learn how the organization is structured, how many people are within it, and where they are located. For your specific field, see if there is a subgroup that specializes in it.
- If you want to have a better sense of how marketing works within a big publisher, look up people working in them on LinkedIn.
- Do research to see what these people and their departments truly look like.
- You can also go to bookstores and befriend people working there.

# Use the least crowded channel

Sometimes, a mid-level doer is inaccessible to meet in person. If this is the case, befriend everyone surrounding them: their manager, assistant, support staff, etc. Befriend everyone.

Alternatively, send them an email and arrange for a video call or schedule to meet in person.

# Interview your potential audience

There are many benefits to interviewing your potential audience.
- It helps you understand the needs of your community.
- It shows you existing paths in your community.
- It tells you the people you need to know.
- It reveals the language your audience understands.
- It shows you how that language can be used to connect your work to your audience.

When doing interviews, remember that your objective is to create relationships with people. This involves how you can develop meaningful connections with them over time.

You can interview the following people:
- the mid-level doers
- the members of the communities you hope to engage
- the people who are fans of work similar to yours

# Dedicate yourself to being present with others

Over metrics or public milestones, prioritize the opportunity to be present with your audience. Aspire to be someone who is there when they need to experience joy, when they need to learn, when they need a helping hand, and when they simply need to know that there is hope.

# Use both online and offline channels

Research will help you determine which channels to use to reach and engage with your audience. Usually, the best strategy is to use a mixture of online and offline channels and to time wisely when to use popular channels and least crowded channels.

# How to build a website

Here are steps you can take in designing your website:

1. Do a survey of ten colleagues to see what their sites look like.
2. Design a website that is simple in both content and design.
3. List the core things your website needs to do then include only those.
4. Include as few items on the navigation bar as possible.
5. Write in the first person.
6. Be clear about what the main gateway represents, and why they would want to enter.
7. Consider whether you will create long-form content.

The key thing to remember when designing is to keep it simple so you are focusing your audience's attention and not splitting it.

# Use both a blog and a newsletter

With a blog, you hope that your audience remembers to visit it (pull). With a newsletter you send content their way (push) so you actively remind them you exist. You can, of course, use newsletters to push new blog content, so it's best to use both.

# How to use social media

The best way to use social media is to use it to build real relationships. This involves sharing useful content, engaging in real conversations, sharing your purpose and process, and celebrating your colleague's wins.

# Use research to craft social media posts that give your audience what they want to feel

Combine research and a deep understanding of what people want to feel to create social media posts that truly engages others. It also doesn't hurt to be inventive.

# Tell other people's stories too

Always try to be generous with your time, attention, talent, and enthusiasm. One way of doing this is sharing other people’s stories as it relates to your vision, not just your own experience.

# Actively direct people to your gateway

Don’t wait for people to find and walk through your gateway on their own. Instead, one by one, bring people to your gateway and assist them in walking through it.

# Share your work like you're sharing to a friend

Sharing your work should feel as natural as conversing with a close friend. This means avoiding things that make you look distant and overly professional, such as writing in the third person.

Be as vulnerable as you can. Share your process, motivations, and roadblocks. Share the complete reality of your life, not just the good things. Be enthusiastic about other people's work as well.

# ==Share emotions that drive you

share the emotion you want others to feel when they experience your work. This practice focuses on experiences, not “things.”

these do not need to be positive emotions.

Emotions of any kind act as a signal and give people a way in.

# Find models outside your field

look for people whose work you admire who also share behind-the-scenes examples of how they have grown their career.

# Treat your audience like royalty no matter how few they are

if you have sixty followers, treat them like the most special people in the world. They are the foundation for how your work will reach more people, and impact the world.

# How to engage with your audience one on one

Connect with one new person per week. Take them out to lunch, email them, or set up a phone call.

focus on engaging more with the top ten percent, those who seem to be more supportive.

Send an email to a colleague—a mid-level doer who practices the same craft you do—and thank them for how their work inspired you.

Interview those who do what you would love to do. You can ask them everything you ever worried about in your own work, but also share the interview to promote them and become aligned with them publicly.

# Develop a support system

identify collaborators

surround yourself with people who understand your work and trust you as a person

ensure your creative vision spreads

Consider how each person you connect with becomes a collaborator—someone who is part of your creative process

For collaborators, start small but intentional.

You simply need someone who can be a sounding board when you have questions, and keep you on track and accountable.

If you want someone to help answer questions, you have to be clear and concise in what you ask, and you have to actually be willing to act on that person’s advice. If you want someone to keep you accountable, you have to illustrate to them that you will do the work, even in the moments they aren’t prodding you.

embrace collaborators early in your process so you can learn what truly engages an audience.

# Find mentors

shadow them, apprentice with them, or meet once per month

consider informal mentorships. Identifying people in your life who you can check in with on a regular basis, but without them having to agree to officially be a mentor for you.

For every second email, ask a simple question that you could use their input on.

asks nothing, but gives quite a bit

the small things you do ask for are framed in a way that illustrates the impact that they will make

# Establish a mastermind group

Small group mastermind
- Each person was allocated one-fourth of the call (20-30 minutes) to tell the group about a specific challenge they had or a goal they were working toward. The rest of their time was spent brainstorming ideas and ways of helping them navigate.

One-on-one mastermind
- speak weekly via the phone, and devote one call to her challenges and one to mine.

Managed mastermind group
- one person acts as the leader of the group and actively manages the group by giving prompts, sharing ideas, and encouraging collaboration.
- members come from different creative fields, have different goals, and are asked to hone in on specific challenges and goals they need assistance with.
- run these groups entirely online using a group chat program and videos.
- members have the ability to chat and post updates 24/7

# How collaborators, mentors, and masterminds help you

helping you better understand those you want to reach and how to effectively communicate and engage with those people.

telling you practical stories of what did and didn’t work for them

allowing you to gain perspective from another person of how they interpret the messages and work you are crafting

# Experiment to make the social aspects of your work fun

my challenge wasn’t that I couldn’t engage with people; it was that I needed a safe context to do so, and one that had a structure to it.

To help people walk through your gateway, experiment with ways to make the social aspects of this fun and reduce the amount of anxiety you may feel.

# Walk people to your gateway again and again

Walking someone through your gate is a process of finding out who that person is, what drives them, and how your gateway aligns with their own path. Don’t assume that once you have crafted your beautiful gateway and the realm that lies beyond it, people can actually reach it.

you are going to have to walk people again and again down the path that leads to your gateway. By doing this, you will learn new things about what motivates those you hope to engage, and you will learn where your “strategy” for engaging others with your work was, in fact, you being willfully ignorant of the gap between your intention and the needs or desires of those you hope to engage.

# Use experiments to gain feedback from your audience to iterate your work

hunting for aspects of your work that capture the interest of others

adjust the work itself based on feedback from your audience

When I found something, I kept exploring it and growing it

multiple channels: my private mastermind, video, blog, email newsletter, webinar, interviews, private emails, and private phone calls.

view opportunities to engage others with your work as experiences you craft, and as a way for you to learn more about who you are hoping to capture and what drives them. Identify ways to experiment to find out what works. Put yourself in the position to have to ask your ideal audience what drives them, or find ways to observe them in action.

Learn more about what works and what engages your ideal audience by conducting many experiments.

# Hold a literary salon

hold a literary salon in your living room, at the local library, or as part of a local organization. Don’t worry about promoting your own work.

experiment with what creates an event that attracts and engages people interested in books similar to yours.

# Create experience, not content

change one person’s life with your creative work right now by crafting meaningful experiences.

While writing an article, creating a podcast, or creating a social media strategy may feel like “audience engagement,” it isn’t.

focus on creating experiences.

Seek out conversations and connections with individuals—something that is specific and truly social. It takes effort to create experiences. Too often, we hide behind the safety of content.

What experiences can you create around your gateway?

be ludicrously kind and generous to those who support your creative work or creative work like yours

Consider how you can give back to specific people in a huge way.

Create an experience and do it really well. Crazy well. The return on investment should be lopsidedly bad. Invest way more than you think you should.

***
# Unsorted

Interview those who do what you would love to do. You can ask them everything you ever worried about in your own work, but also share the interview to promote them and become aligned with them publicly.

understanding the connection between what you create, why you create it, and how it will engage others.

it is about showing up each day to do the work. It is about building a habit that is practical and accessible.
