# Focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment rather than market performance and public milestones

Set creative goals based on specific experiences that you want your work to bring to specific people, with faces, rather than objects, tokens, or metrics. Focusing on the former provides the feelings of validation and success. Focusing on the later results to impostor syndrome.

Similarly, use reader experience as the benchmark for the value of your work rather than market performance. This involves focusing on one-on-one engagement rather than virality.

Focusing on reader experience also means that success is easier to achieve. You don't have to be a bestseller to make a difference.

Reader experience is how the reader experiences the world through your creative work.

>remember names and faces, and moments with these people

>think about specific experiences that indicate that you and your work connected with, and influenced, the lives of others

>they don’t lead to the feeling of validation or success that these artists hoped for. Rather, they create a sense of impostor syndrome

>Instead of framing the value of your work by how it performs in the market, you define it by how other people experience the world through your creative work—the stories and experiences you share, and the topics you talk about.

>Instead of selling a product in a marketplace, you become the gateway for how your work can shape the world for others, and inspire them.

>find success by focusing on the human side of that which engages people, what it means to have your work truly shape the lives of others, and what it means to feel fulfilled as a creator

>help others make sense out of life

>Don’t just throw “products” out into the marketplace; change the way people see the world through your creative work.

>Being a gateway is about ensuring your work truly connects with others in the most meaningful way possible

# Public milestones are deceptive

object
token
metric

they shouldn’t be the goal
they mask the true impact of your work
We calculate that objects, tokens, and metrics will ensure that greater success will now come with less effort, but that doesn’t happen.

they don’t lead to the feeling of validation or success that these artists hoped for. Rather, they create a sense of impostor syndrome

someone with impostor syndrome is riddled with anxiety that they will be revealed as a fraud, and that they can never live up to the success people now expect of them.

Even those authors who did find success with sales can still seem confused as to why the book worked, who their audience is, and how to follow it up. They feel naked and exposed, worried that they will “mess up” a success that they barely understand.

Achieving these traditional markers for success—objects, tokens, and metrics—can make someone feel more lost, because they assumed this process would unlock something new for them, and instead, nothing is different.

# Focus on one-on-one engagement

>Reframe success so it isn’t about seeking validation from massive audiences, but rather how you reach one person. The people I see who succeed focus on one-on-one engagement with other people, not on going viral.

# Focusing on reader experience and personal fulfillment makes success more accessible

You can take action to connect with people who love your work via your gateway right now. You can take clear actions day by day, week by week, to reach the people who care about your work. When you create as a gateway, success immediately becomes more accessible.

Being a gateway is a higher calling than an object, token, or metric. It’s also more fun.

==Writing to create an experience for the reader is ministry itself. A for of service.==

# Share your process and journey as it happens

identify how your story relates to the gateway you’re crafting

understanding the connection between what you create, why you create it, and how it will engage others.

building a path to your gateway

signals to people that it is worth continuing down because right around the corner is what they seek

it is about showing up each day to do the work. It is about building a habit that is practical and accessible.

they begin to feel as they are a part of the process.

When you share your journey, you are building advocates in the process; those who aren’t just aware of what you are doing, but feel connected to it in a personal way. When it comes time for you to release your creative work, you will have a crowd of people ready to help it spread.

sharing an authentic look at how their creative vision aligns with what their ideal audience dreams about

focus on sharing experiences you have, because this is indeed how stories are created. Focus on conversations you have, because this is where you are already connecting to others on that authentic human level. Focus on how you can connect with others today around your work. How you are curious, how you are developing your skills, how you are relishing moments where you feel inspired.

Instead of dreaming up some “big brand” you want to create, simply document and share what you are passionate about. This encourages you to be aware of how your daily life aligns to your creative work. It forces you to be accountable for attending to it. When you share what drives you and how you attend to your creative work, it prevents you from getting lost in the dream.

don’t sell me on your work by telling me how great it is; instead, show me the process, show me why your work matters to you, and how it can connect to what I care about.

# Be a gateway for people to experience a worldview

She has become a lightning rod for belief systems, for a worldview. She has become the gateway for how her fans experience the world, experience each other, and experience themselves.

what you share within your creative work—and outside of it—can embody the deeper themes that drive you, and that engage your ideal audience.

find and tell stories that resonate with us. Become the voice for others … the gateway for them to share their stories with the world.

# Three elements to be a gateway

1. Story. Craft a compelling story.
2. Creator. Become the personal way through which the reader experiences a larger topic.
3. Topics. The issues, the narratives that your story digs into.

each level deeper and more personal than the next. This is what you should craft for your work

# Extend a book by content

The platform you develop around a book should not try to re-create it—what you share online and in person should not just steal all of the stories you share in the book itself. Instead, it should tap into aspects of the story, and then extend them in new ways that the book could not

use it [social media] to tell a story—an original story—that opens up a worldview for people.

# Effects of a gateway to individuals

• They experience a compelling story or experience
• They see the world in a new way
• They shape their own identity

You are a gateway to the identity that someone wants for themselves, or that highlights an aspect of themselves they want to be more clear, more in the forefront, more real. Even if your work takes years to craft, you can still be a gateway right now. Even to one person.

Opening up their world. Their identity. Their experience. Their connection to others.

You are not creating a “fan,” or a customer. You are providing someone something much deeper, which is a sense of themselves and the world around them.

# A gateway where author meets audience is inevitable

Even when we find someone’s narrative that seems more “pure” about the strength of the art itself finding an audience, a gateway is still present.

# Use your gateway to shape how others accept your works

Through your creative work, you get to craft the stories of how others find and engage with it. Your art, your craft is not objective—it will be experienced by different people in different ways. You get to shape that, and it becomes the gateway for others.

# Help your reader build an identity using narratives

What does your audience want, more than anything? An identity

People don’t buy things; they buy the feeling that things give them. They are investing in the building blocks of their own identity, and how this helps creates narratives they can show others.

Your audience lives by narratives. This is how they express their identity. They want a narrative that makes sense of the world. It is not just a reflection on the world, but their place within it. It justifies their decisions. It allays their fears. It motivates their hopes.

you will be offering people a chance to align with the narratives that engage them.

# A gateway is where the author's and reader's narratives converge

When you consider how you are a gateway for others, understanding your narrative, understanding theirs, and connecting the two is inherently what you are offering.

know what you stand for, and to share it in a way that truly speaks to others

It is how you craft and share your work with others

# Provide narratives people need

When you understand the narratives your ideal audience seeks, you know how to engage those people. You know how to grab their attention, you know how to get them to lean in, and to become so enamored that they can’t help but tell their friends.

you are truly creating conversations around what you create.

# Find your narratives by identifying your values

To find and align your narratives, I encourage you to identify what matters most to you across your entire life, not just in your creative work. You have only so many resources of time, energy and money. Too many people fail in their creative work because they don't accept and embrace that.

if you want to succeed in being a gateway for others, you have to hone in on what matters to you more than anything.

This is where many people fail. They come up with a clever idea for a craft, a book, or a business, and they shove it into an otherwise crowded narrative. It’s “in addition to,” not a core part of what matters most to them. They fail because they care about this idea only insofar as it is clever and represents a lottery ticket in their life. They dream that if their idea takes off quickly, they will invest more of their life in it. What they are hoping for is that if they develop it just barely enough, others will come in and validate the idea, help it spread, and turn it into a movement. In other words, they want quick validation where others make the path to success easier for them.

Why did this one person succeed? Because they believed in it more. It was more core to their personal narrative of what mattered, and where they could devote their time, energy, and money.

think about what you would fight to not lose. Those are your narratives. This is where you will put your energy every day, every week, and every month. It is where you will keep that flame alive long after others would have given up.

This is something you would fight for. Where, if the book failed to sell more than thirty copies, you move onto the next book about an underdog, or brainstorm other creative ways to help inspire others to find strength when they feel hopeless.

making choices about what you care most about, but also thinking about how you can use them to craft the narrative of who you are and what you believe. The gateway you craft begins with who you are.

# Spend time on the things you want to be known for

If you want people to make time to experience your creative vision, then you have to make time to create it.

Is there a disconnect between what you do every week versus what you you want to be known for?

# Your narratives are your values and practice

1. The things in life that you care so much about that you would fight to protect them, and to ensure that they can reach their full potential.
2. A practice. What you do every single day

# Other ways to find your narratives

Consider what you love talking about. What topics could you sit at a cafe or bar and talk about for hours and hours? What types of people do you seek out and enjoy chatting with?

What are common traits of these people, what resonates with you about them, and they with you?

# How to craft a mission statement for your writing

identify a simple sentence that focuses on the experience you want your writing to create for others.

think about someone who purchased and read your book nine months ago. How do you hope it shifted the way they think?

Nine months after someone reads your book, what do you want them to think quietly in their heads about the world you have opened for them? How does it relate to their life, their identity, their interactions?

Write down a series of belief statements—things that you feel resonate in your creative work. Sit with them for a week, reviewing them each day.

at the end of the week, choose one that you are drawn to the most. Don’t worry, just like paint, you can change it over time.

ensuring that you believe in your gateway with such clarity—such verve—that nothing can shake it.

# Write a bio that reinforces your qualification for writing your works

Your bio is the centerpiece of the narrative that connects the work you create and who you are.

describe who you are and how your experience makes you the perfect person to write the books you are working on.

Your bio should embody not just a chronological view of your life, but the narratives that fuel you.

1. A belief statement that your ideal reader would read and say “YES! This!”
2. A description of the one thing you desperately want that reader to care about. (Hint: this should be your creative work.)
3. Your credentials as they relate to your creative work.
4. Your background and experience. Filter this through your creative work.
5. Who you are as a person. This is where your hobbies, where you live, and your background come in. Only after you have hooked us with the narratives that we care about.

# Bio Step #1: Start With a Belief Statement

Don’t start your biography at the beginning of your life and work forward. Instead, start with the present and work backward.

don’t start with you at all. Instead, start with me

If you want me to pause from what I am doing to give you and your work a chance, you have to create a bridge. That bridge is from the things I desperately care about and engage with to what you and your work are about.

If your goal is to have someone engage with you, you have to begin with empathy and start with them, not you.

This can take the form of a belief statement—the things that embody your work and your drive to create that would resonate with your ideal audience. This will be a version of the mission statement you crafted above. It can be what you are fighting for, or what you are fighting against. It can be a feeling that you want people to have when they experience your work. It can be a story that is shorthand for what your audience wants to align with.

# Bio Step #2: Focus on Your Creative Work

There are two common mistakes I see people make at this stage. The first is (again), people start at the beginning and work their way forward. They tell the reader about their very first forays into their art or craft, and then walk us through it slowly working their way to the present.

The second mistake people make in this section is to list too many things all at once, as if each has equal importance.

slow down and focus first on the thing that matters to you in your creative work right now.

# Bio Step #3: Your Credentials

build the case for why you are the perfect person to be creating the creative work you just described.

align to the narratives and stories we talked about earlier. This can take the form of a story as to how you got into your craft, or why it matters to you.

# Bio Step #4: Your Background and Experience

go broader into other areas of your life beyond your creative work

filter it through your creative work

# Bio Step #5: Personal Details

this is where you can place anything that didn’t fit.

# Make honing your gateway a habit

Your gateway is a process not unlike your creative work. You will hone it via habits, keen observation, and experimentation. Day by day, it will feel more true, as if it is the thing that people have been waiting to welcome into their lives.

# Hone your gateway by doing creative work each week

==Insight: Gateway is content marketing.==

Analyze whether every aspect that surrounds your creative work embodies your mission statement. This begins with the creative work itself.

Craft your gateway by doing your creative work each week.

Develop a simple personal habit of focusing on your creative work and how you share it with others. This is a critical distinction: you are not creating a product (a book, album, craft) that you are selling in a marketplace. That is simply a milestone. You are connecting other human beings to your stories and knowledge and, as a gateway, are opening them up to something new.

track your progress of developing a daily habit, establish a system to recognize it.

Be accountable to yourself before you ask others to validate and support you.

Identify the “single push-up” for your creative work each day.

have a practice of creating your work that focuses on your mission

# Hone your mission statement by using it in conversations

just as your creative work does, it needs to grow and evolve. Say your mission statement out loud. Does it sound weird? If so, then craft a spoken version that aligns to the written version. Use it in casual conversations.

seek out these conversations to test it.

See how this feels to say it out loud to another person. Note where you lose them—where they don’t understand, where it falls flat, and what their follow-up questions are. Use this to hone the language of your mission statement so that it is not only clear to you, but clear to others.

# Prepare for bad days

When developing your creative vision, plan for disaster.

When you lose faith and clarity in your own vision and work, prepare a “reset” that reminds you of why you create. This could be a quote from your hero, a photo that sparks your imagination on what is possible, a biography or documentary about someone who inspires you, or a song that centers you.

Create check-ins in your calendar—daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly—where you write down the progress you have made.

recognize and honor the things you do accomplish. This could be a simple statement each day that you write down

Have an “emergency call” list of three people who motivate you. These should be individuals you trust, who believe in the possibility of what you want to create, and would take your call without judgment.

Very often, our own internal fear of judgment will prevent us from reaching out to others for a moment of help. If you want to be successful in your creative work, you need to let go of that fear.

# Aspire for sustainability

Do I want you to be wildly successful with your creative work? Sure. But what I want more for you is that you keep sharing your voice and your vision with new work; that this work, over time, changes the lives of others for the better; that you concurrently develop slow organic growth, but also increase the chances of serendipitous luck that connects your work to even more people.

# Opening your gateway is finding your people and bringing them into you gateway

The goal should not be data; the goal should be a demonstrable impact that your work has had on someone’s life. To experience this, you need to open the gateway you have built.

Opening the gate is about finding your people. Knowing what resonates with them, where they hang out, and who reaches them. Then, one by one, bringing them through the gate.
