# Focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment rather than market performance and public milestones

Set creative goals based on specific experiences that you want your work to bring to specific people, with faces, rather than objects, tokens, or metrics. Focusing on the former provides the feelings of validation and success. Focusing on the later results to impostor syndrome.

Similarly, use reader experience as the benchmark for the value of your work rather than market performance. This involves focusing on one-on-one engagement rather than virality.

Focusing on reader experience also means that success is easier to achieve. You don't have to be a bestseller to make a difference.

Reader experience is how the reader experiences the world through your creative work.

>remember names and faces, and moments with these people

>think about specific experiences that indicate that you and your work connected with, and influenced, the lives of others

>they don’t lead to the feeling of validation or success that these artists hoped for. Rather, they create a sense of impostor syndrome

>Instead of framing the value of your work by how it performs in the market, you define it by how other people experience the world through your creative work—the stories and experiences you share, and the topics you talk about.

>Instead of selling a product in a marketplace, you become the gateway for how your work can shape the world for others, and inspire them.

>find success by focusing on the human side of that which engages people, what it means to have your work truly shape the lives of others, and what it means to feel fulfilled as a creator

>help others make sense out of life

>Don’t just throw “products” out into the marketplace; change the way people see the world through your creative work.

>Being a gateway is about ensuring your work truly connects with others in the most meaningful way possible

# Public milestones are deceptive

object
token
metric

they shouldn’t be the goal
they mask the true impact of your work
We calculate that objects, tokens, and metrics will ensure that greater success will now come with less effort, but that doesn’t happen.

they don’t lead to the feeling of validation or success that these artists hoped for. Rather, they create a sense of impostor syndrome

someone with impostor syndrome is riddled with anxiety that they will be revealed as a fraud, and that they can never live up to the success people now expect of them.

Even those authors who did find success with sales can still seem confused as to why the book worked, who their audience is, and how to follow it up. They feel naked and exposed, worried that they will “mess up” a success that they barely understand.

Achieving these traditional markers for success—objects, tokens, and metrics—can make someone feel more lost, because they assumed this process would unlock something new for them, and instead, nothing is different.

# Focus on one-on-one engagement

>Reframe success so it isn’t about seeking validation from massive audiences, but rather how you reach one person. The people I see who succeed focus on one-on-one engagement with other people, not on going viral.

# Focusing on reader experience and personal fulfillment makes success more accessible

You can take action to connect with people who love your work via your gateway right now. You can take clear actions day by day, week by week, to reach the people who care about your work. When you create as a gateway, success immediately becomes more accessible.

Being a gateway is a higher calling than an object, token, or metric. It’s also more fun.

==Writing to create an experience for the reader is ministry itself. A for of service.==

# Share your process and journey as it happens

identify how your story relates to the gateway you’re crafting

understanding the connection between what you create, why you create it, and how it will engage others.

building a path to your gateway

signals to people that it is worth continuing down because right around the corner is what they seek

it is about showing up each day to do the work. It is about building a habit that is practical and accessible.

they begin to feel as they are a part of the process.

When you share your journey, you are building advocates in the process; those who aren’t just aware of what you are doing, but feel connected to it in a personal way. When it comes time for you to release your creative work, you will have a crowd of people ready to help it spread.

sharing an authentic look at how their creative vision aligns with what their ideal audience dreams about

focus on sharing experiences you have, because this is indeed how stories are created. Focus on conversations you have, because this is where you are already connecting to others on that authentic human level. Focus on how you can connect with others today around your work. How you are curious, how you are developing your skills, how you are relishing moments where you feel inspired.

Instead of dreaming up some “big brand” you want to create, simply document and share what you are passionate about. This encourages you to be aware of how your daily life aligns to your creative work. It forces you to be accountable for attending to it. When you share what drives you and how you attend to your creative work, it prevents you from getting lost in the dream.

don’t sell me on your work by telling me how great it is; instead, show me the process, show me why your work matters to you, and how it can connect to what I care about.

# Be a gateway for people to experience a worldview

She has become a lightning rod for belief systems, for a worldview. She has become the gateway for how her fans experience the world, experience each other, and experience themselves.

what you share within your creative work—and outside of it—can embody the deeper themes that drive you, and that engage your ideal audience.

find and tell stories that resonate with us. Become the voice for others … the gateway for them to share their stories with the world.

# Three elements to be a gateway

1. Story. Craft a compelling story.
2. Creator. Become the personal way through which the reader experiences a larger topic.
3. Topics. The issues, the narratives that your story digs into.

each level deeper and more personal than the next. This is what you should craft for your work

# Extend a book by content

The platform you develop around a book should not try to re-create it—what you share online and in person should not just steal all of the stories you share in the book itself. Instead, it should tap into aspects of the story, and then extend them in new ways that the book could not

use it [social media] to tell a story—an original story—that opens up a worldview for people.

# Effects of a gateway to individuals

• They experience a compelling story or experience
• They see the world in a new way
• They shape their own identity

You are a gateway to the identity that someone wants for themselves, or that highlights an aspect of themselves they want to be more clear, more in the forefront, more real. Even if your work takes years to craft, you can still be a gateway right now. Even to one person.

Opening up their world. Their identity. Their experience. Their connection to others.

You are not creating a “fan,” or a customer. You are providing someone something much deeper, which is a sense of themselves and the world around them.

# A gateway where author meets audience is inevitable

Even when we find someone’s narrative that seems more “pure” about the strength of the art itself finding an audience, a gateway is still present.

# Use your gateway to shape how others accept your works

Through your creative work, you get to craft the stories of how others find and engage with it. Your art, your craft is not objective—it will be experienced by different people in different ways. You get to shape that, and it becomes the gateway for others.

# Help your reader build an identity using narratives

What does your audience want, more than anything? An identity

People don’t buy things; they buy the feeling that things give them. They are investing in the building blocks of their own identity, and how this helps creates narratives they can show others.

Your audience lives by narratives. This is how they express their identity. They want a narrative that makes sense of the world. It is not just a reflection on the world, but their place within it. It justifies their decisions. It allays their fears. It motivates their hopes.

you will be offering people a chance to align with the narratives that engage them.

# A gateway is where the author's and reader's narratives converge

When you consider how you are a gateway for others, understanding your narrative, understanding theirs, and connecting the two is inherently what you are offering.

# Provide narratives people need

When you understand the narratives your ideal audience seeks, you know how to engage those people. You know how to grab their attention, you know how to get them to lean in, and to become so enamored that they can’t help but tell their friends.

you are truly creating conversations around what you create.

# Find your narratives by identifying your values

To find and align your narratives, I encourage you to identify what matters most to you across your entire life, not just in your creative work. You have only so many resources of time, energy and money. Too many people fail in their creative work because they don't accept and embrace that.

if you want to succeed in being a gateway for others, you have to hone in on what matters to you more than anything.

This is where many people fail. They come up with a clever idea for a craft, a book, or a business, and they shove it into an otherwise crowded narrative. It’s “in addition to,” not a core part of what matters most to them. They fail because they care about this idea only insofar as it is clever and represents a lottery ticket in their life. They dream that if their idea takes off quickly, they will invest more of their life in it. What they are hoping for is that if they develop it just barely enough, others will come in and validate the idea, help it spread, and turn it into a movement. In other words, they want quick validation where others make the path to success easier for them.

Why did this one person succeed? Because they believed in it more. It was more core to their personal narrative of what mattered, and where they could devote their time, energy, and money.

think about what you would fight to not lose. Those are your narratives. This is where you will put your energy every day, every week, and every month. It is where you will keep that flame alive long after others would have given up.

This is something you would fight for. Where, if the book failed to sell more than thirty copies, you move onto the next book about an underdog, or brainstorm other creative ways to help inspire others to find strength when they feel hopeless.

making choices about what you care most about, but also thinking about how you can use them to craft the narrative of who you are and what you believe. The gateway you craft begins with who you are.

# Spend time on the things you want to be known for

If you want people to make time to experience your creative vision, then you have to make time to create it.

Is there a disconnect between what you do every week versus what you you want to be known for?

# Your narratives are your values and practice

1. The things in life that you care so much about that you would fight to protect them, and to ensure that they can reach their full potential.
2. A practice. What you do every single day
