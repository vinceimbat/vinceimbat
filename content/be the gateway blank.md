# Focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment

Focus you efforts in:
- understanding your reader and the experience they are looking for
- creating work that generates that experience
- creating work in a way that feels right

Let go of:
- objects (publications)
- tokens (awards, workshops)
- metrics (followers, sales, etc.)

The real value of your work depends on its ability to produce meaningful reader experience.

If you focus on reader experience, you can immediately help someone and you'll be successful more easily.

# Signs that you have focused on reader experience

- You can remember the names and faces of your readers.
- You can remember moments you had with your readers.
- It feels like your work is a way for others to see the world differently and not just a product.
- You receive feedback that you work influenced or even shaped the lives of your readers.

# Public milestones are deceptive

Objects, tokens, and metrics shouldn't be your goal. Treat these as side effects of you doing the real work of learning about your audience, creating the best experiences for them, and building lasting relationships with them.

Public milestones are deceptive. They mask the true impact of your work, and they make you think that once you've achieved them your work becomes easier. It doesn't.

If you overvalue public milestones, they could even lead to impostor syndrome (feeling like a fraud and being pressured to live up to others' expectations). To avoid this, focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment.

# Focus on one-on-one engagement

Seek validation in reaching one person and engaging with them deeply. Focus on one person at a time. Begin to do this long before you even create or launch your work. If you already have an audience in front of you, start with them.

This could change the momentum of your creative life.

Your task is to:
1. Learn where your people hang out
2. Learn what they need
3. Learn what they love
4. Learn how they want to engage
5. Learn how they relate to your creative work (or existing things similar to yours)
6. Engage with them directly one by one

What does engagement look like?
1. Seek out small conversations
2. Perform tiny ways of helping
3. Have meaningful conversations
4. Share
5. Show empathy

Develop your own practices and routines to reach out to members of your audience.

# Focusing on reader experience and personal fulfillment makes success more accessible

You may need to spend years to perfect your craft, but when you focus on reader experience and personal fulfillment, you immediately succeed. Establish daily and regular practices and routines to nurture your relationship with your audience one by one. See your writing as a form of ministry.

# Share your process and journey as it happens

Sharing your process and journey is how you tell others to follow a path that leads to your gateway, which is what people seek.

Benefits of sharing your process:
- Makes people feel that they are part of the process.
- Builds advocates connected to your work in a personal way that will help spread your work.
- It makes you aware of how your daily life aligns to your creative work, holding you accountable.

To know whaat to share, you must relate your story with your gateway

What should you share
- experiences (as connected to your creative work)
- conversations (as connected to your creative work)
- curiosities
- how you are developing your skills
- how you are relishing moments where you feel inspired
- how your work matters to you and how it can connect to what your reader cares about
- behind the scenes of how you do your work
- materials you use
- milestones
- educate them on the elements that makes incredible work
- what drives you on a deeper level

# Your gateway is how your reader experiences a worldview

Build a gateway that represents a belief system or worldview that allows your reader to experience the world and themselves in it. Use your gateway to explore the deeper themes that drive you and engage your ideal audience. Become a voice for them, that is, let your work tell their stories to the world.

# A gateway consists a story, creator, and topics

To build a gateway, you must craft a compelling story, use your self to help your reader experience a larger topic, and write narratives that flow from your story. Help your reader get deeper into the gateway.

# Extend a book by content

Build a platform around a book by extending the book and not stealing from it. Write new stories to extend the book in content for social media, blog, or newsletter.

# Use your gateway to help someone build their identity

Identity is what your reader want the most. Using your gateway, help your reader define or clarify their identity (or an aspect of it) so they can open their authentic self more to the world. Facilitate how your reader could find something deep within them that they could use to make sense of their world and their place in it.

# A gateway where author meets audience is always present

Even in works where a gateway is not intentionally built, it is still there.

# Use your gateway to shape how others accept your works

Since a gateway is always present, it is better to shape it intentionally so you can shape how others see your work.

# Help your reader build an identity using narratives

Your reader expresses their identity through narratives. They also use these narratives to understand the world and their place in it, justify their decisions, and motivate themselves.

Identify what these narratives are then provide them to help your reader gain what they're looking for. By knowing the narratives they need, you will engage them more effectively and you will win their trust.

# A gateway is where the author's and reader's narratives converge

Your creative works is a bridge between your narrative and the narrative of your reader. Establish your narrative (including what you stand for) and share it in a way that speaks to your reader.

# Your values, practices, and passions tell your narratives

Identify what matters most in your life (not just in creating).
- Things you pour your time, energy, and money into.
- Things you would fight for.
- Things you would put your time and energy every day, week, and month.
- Things you wouldn't give up

Try to pursue only projects that are a core part of what matters most in your life (not just in addition to them). Because you believe in what matters most in your life, you will also believe more in your projects regardless of external validation from the marketplace and through public milestones.

Along with these values are the practices that express them. Both inform the narratives you tell and that connects you with your reader.

The topics you could talk about nonstop and the people you enjoy being around also tell your narratives.

# Spend time on the things you want to be known for

You can only convince people to make time for your creative vision if you make time to create it.

***

# How to craft a mission statement for your writing

identify a simple sentence that focuses on the experience you want your writing to create for others.

think about someone who purchased and read your book nine months ago. How do you hope it shifted the way they think?

Nine months after someone reads your book, what do you want them to think quietly in their heads about the world you have opened for them? How does it relate to their life, their identity, their interactions?

Write down a series of belief statements—things that you feel resonate in your creative work. Sit with them for a week, reviewing them each day.

at the end of the week, choose one that you are drawn to the most. Don’t worry, just like paint, you can change it over time.

ensuring that you believe in your gateway with such clarity—such verve—that nothing can shake it.

# Write a bio that reinforces your qualification for writing your works

Your bio is the centerpiece of the narrative that connects the work you create and who you are.

describe who you are and how your experience makes you the perfect person to write the books you are working on.

Your bio should embody not just a chronological view of your life, but the narratives that fuel you.

1. A belief statement that your ideal reader would read and say “YES! This!”
2. A description of the one thing you desperately want that reader to care about. (Hint: this should be your creative work.)
3. Your credentials as they relate to your creative work.
4. Your background and experience. Filter this through your creative work.
5. Who you are as a person. This is where your hobbies, where you live, and your background come in. Only after you have hooked us with the narratives that we care about.

# Bio Step #1: Start With a Belief Statement

Don’t start your biography at the beginning of your life and work forward. Instead, start with the present and work backward.

don’t start with you at all. Instead, start with me

If you want me to pause from what I am doing to give you and your work a chance, you have to create a bridge. That bridge is from the things I desperately care about and engage with to what you and your work are about.

If your goal is to have someone engage with you, you have to begin with empathy and start with them, not you.

This can take the form of a belief statement—the things that embody your work and your drive to create that would resonate with your ideal audience. This will be a version of the mission statement you crafted above. It can be what you are fighting for, or what you are fighting against. It can be a feeling that you want people to have when they experience your work. It can be a story that is shorthand for what your audience wants to align with.

# Bio Step #2: Focus on Your Creative Work

There are two common mistakes I see people make at this stage. The first is (again), people start at the beginning and work their way forward. They tell the reader about their very first forays into their art or craft, and then walk us through it slowly working their way to the present.

The second mistake people make in this section is to list too many things all at once, as if each has equal importance.

slow down and focus first on the thing that matters to you in your creative work right now.

# Bio Step #3: Your Credentials

build the case for why you are the perfect person to be creating the creative work you just described.

align to the narratives and stories we talked about earlier. This can take the form of a story as to how you got into your craft, or why it matters to you.

# Bio Step #4: Your Background and Experience

go broader into other areas of your life beyond your creative work

filter it through your creative work

# Bio Step #5: Personal Details

this is where you can place anything that didn’t fit.

# Make honing your gateway a habit

Your gateway is a process not unlike your creative work. You will hone it via habits, keen observation, and experimentation. Day by day, it will feel more true, as if it is the thing that people have been waiting to welcome into their lives.

# Hone your gateway by doing creative work each week

==Insight: Gateway is content marketing.==

Analyze whether every aspect that surrounds your creative work embodies your mission statement. This begins with the creative work itself.

Craft your gateway by doing your creative work each week.

Develop a simple personal habit of focusing on your creative work and how you share it with others. This is a critical distinction: you are not creating a product (a book, album, craft) that you are selling in a marketplace. That is simply a milestone. You are connecting other human beings to your stories and knowledge and, as a gateway, are opening them up to something new.

track your progress of developing a daily habit, establish a system to recognize it.

Be accountable to yourself before you ask others to validate and support you.

Identify the “single push-up” for your creative work each day.

have a practice of creating your work that focuses on your mission

# Hone your mission statement by using it in conversations

just as your creative work does, it needs to grow and evolve. Say your mission statement out loud. Does it sound weird? If so, then craft a spoken version that aligns to the written version. Use it in casual conversations.

seek out these conversations to test it.

See how this feels to say it out loud to another person. Note where you lose them—where they don’t understand, where it falls flat, and what their follow-up questions are. Use this to hone the language of your mission statement so that it is not only clear to you, but clear to others.

# Prepare for bad days

When developing your creative vision, plan for disaster.

When you lose faith and clarity in your own vision and work, prepare a “reset” that reminds you of why you create. This could be a quote from your hero, a photo that sparks your imagination on what is possible, a biography or documentary about someone who inspires you, or a song that centers you.

Create check-ins in your calendar—daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly—where you write down the progress you have made.

recognize and honor the things you do accomplish. This could be a simple statement each day that you write down

Have an “emergency call” list of three people who motivate you. These should be individuals you trust, who believe in the possibility of what you want to create, and would take your call without judgment.

Very often, our own internal fear of judgment will prevent us from reaching out to others for a moment of help. If you want to be successful in your creative work, you need to let go of that fear.

# Aspire for sustainability

Do I want you to be wildly successful with your creative work? Sure. But what I want more for you is that you keep sharing your voice and your vision with new work; that this work, over time, changes the lives of others for the better; that you concurrently develop slow organic growth, but also increase the chances of serendipitous luck that connects your work to even more people.

# Opening your gateway is finding your people and bringing them into you gateway

The goal should not be data; the goal should be a demonstrable impact that your work has had on someone’s life. To experience this, you need to open the gateway you have built.

Opening the gate is about finding your people. Knowing what resonates with them, where they hang out, and who reaches them. Then, one by one, bringing them through the gate.

# Universal skills to find your people

develop the skills that are universal and timeless to find your people, know what resonates, craft a connection, and help them to find alignment with your creative work.

1. Awareness
2. Consideration
3. Conversion
4. Loyalty
5. Advocacy

The top—the widest part of the inverted pyramid—represents the broadest possible message to the largest group of people. Each step down the funnel slowly leads those who are most interested in what you have to offer to deeper levels of engagement with you and your work.

# Nurture advocates

the marketing funnel doesn’t end with a sale

For your creative work to grow, you have to envision the sale as one milestone in a much bigger process, one where people who buy from you tell others about your work.

For a creative professional selling their work, their biggest source of revenue is often repeat customers.

# Really know your audience

find and explore the path that your ideal audience already knows and walks along every day

have empathy for who they are, what they already know, their habits, their interests, and who they trust. If you want people to find your gateway and walk through, you first have to walk a mile in their shoes.

understanding them and their marketplace, and using that to hone how to communicate about the work you create. It helps you identify where you need to be, what engages others, and who you need to know. It also helps ensure that this is fun and meaningful for both you and them.

Spend time “in the field” to learn about where these people are, who they are, and what engages them. All the while, take into account who you want to reach, your vision, and your goals. Primary research means figuring things out on your own.

The most effective way for you to engage with others is to have a keen sense of empathy, to learn about what drives them, and to craft conversations that connect this to your own drive and creative work.

establish a sense of empathy for what that experience is like, which will result in you making many small adjustments to ensure it truly engages others. Creative work fails to find an audience when the creator assumes a specific intrinsic value within it that their ideal audience is never able to see or experience because the creator didn’t make it clear to them. Walking someone through the gate is a process of helping others experience your work, by having empathy with how they see the world.

# Position your gateway where your readers already walk

Instead of constructing your gateway out in the wilderness where there are no pre-existing paths, we are going to construct it closer to where your ideal audience already walks. Find the paths they know and love, so you can place your gateway in exactly the right spot. You are going to ensure the words you use to attract people to your gateway are understood by your ideal audience, engaging them and drawing them closer. Your work will speak to them when and where they need it; and when the moment is right, you can open the gate for them to pass through.

# Perform direct primary research

do primary research in consistent and action-oriented ways

truly understand who the ideal audience for your work is.

You can put names and faces to them.

develop colleagues (others who work in your field, support the type of creative work that you do, connect that work to an audience, and are advocates for it)

Doing primary research lays the foundation for capturing the attention of your ideal audience in a way that is sustainable and meaningful.

- what your ideal audience cares about
- where they hang out online and off
- what other creative work they love and why
- who they admire and listen to

Doing this allows audience outreach to feel meaningful to you, where every time you learn something new about your audience, it fuels a deep sense of momentum.

# How to find your audience

use landmarks for you to move outward from where you are to understand the marketplace where your creative work will exist, and then, to find your ideal audience.

turning the same landmarks into guideposts to leave a trail for people to follow to lead them back to your gateway.

Landmarks are the examples of what you hope your creative work aspires to be like, which your ideal audience knows universally as the best example of the kind of work you do.

focus on the positive emotions people feel about similar work already, and redirect those emotions and attention to your own creations.

comps
- other things in the marketplace that your ideal audience likely already knows, and has some similarities to what you create and why they may love it.

consider how your audience reacts to the landmarks you identify, and how they can use those to become aware of yours.

use comps to help you understand how your work fits into the lives of your ideal audience, how others would describe it, to use as a model for success, and to begin uncovering the path that leads to your gateway.

# How to find comps

Find Five Comparable Works

had some success, but if possible, not be the breakout hits that defined a generation.

- released within the past one to five years
- some level of public validation, such as reviews
- within the same field as the one where you create

/1. Begin with Landmarks

start with the big prominent names in your field—the people who everyone knows. Go to the marketplaces where this work is shared or sold.

**For books online, go to Amazon or Goodreads.** For physical books, go to libraries or bookstores.

begin with the landmark in your field whose work you feel has some relation to yours.

this landmark exercise is not about defining who you are, but simply understanding how the marketplace categorizes work such as yours.

/2. Find Guideposts

find the people who have created similar work to you, finding success in the process, but perhaps haven’t had massive breakout hits.

Go into Amazon and type in the names of the authors you have identified whose works are landmarks for you, or the names of specific books that you feel are guides. Now, scroll down to the “Customers Who Bought This Item Also Bought” section and click on each book. Keep scrolling to see all of the books Amazon displays here. Amazon provides similar features that may be useful, such as “What Other Items Do Customers Buy After Viewing This Item?”, “Frequently Bought Together”, and even “Sponsored Products Related To This Item.”

look for those that were published within the past five years, which have some reviews (at least twenty), and most importantly, that you feel resonate with the work you create in some way.

Write down the names of the books and authors whose work resembles yours in some way; note why that is the case.

seek out other authors who write in the same topic or genre as you do. Show up to their events, email them, support their work. Be curious about their readers. Ask them questions about what they love and why.

/3. Obsess About the Voice of the Reader

put you in touch with five local readers who loved it. Then, you are going to talk to those five people.

For the comps you have identified in the previous step, go to Amazon and begin reading through reviews.

We want to know what readers liked about the book, what they didn’t like, and why. Pay very close attention to the language they use. Look for trends in terms of phrases or focus.

For each of the comps you find, identify how others categorize them. You can look at the Amazon category rankings

make note of phrases you see again and again, or phrases you are curious to see pop up. Then, type those into the search box and see which occur more frequently.

Review “best of” lists each year, but also user-generated lists that are created on sites, such as Amazon for authors

Review how the artist describes their work. Look for phrases that resonate.

Do Google searches on the work that you do find, even on the most basic definitions of what that work is. Switch to a Google image search to see what comes up. Then do a Google video search. Don’t stop at the first sign that validates what you already know. Challenge your assumptions, and move well beyond the first page of Google search results.

Look for mentions of these comps anywhere you can find it—blogs, podcasts, within major media, and well outside of it.

When seeking examples to help guide you, the question you want to ask yourself is, “Who is doing work that matters and is succeeding at it?”

# Befriend people who have experience in your field

These are the individuals who have already engaged an audience similar to the one you want for your work. Their own work embodies similar things that yours does.

you don’t just want to have a map of your marketplace, you want to befriend those who have deep experience within it.

# Find mid-level doers

creative professionals who are mid-career, have found a sustainable way to focus on their creative work, and are a healthy mixture of aspirational and accessible.

You aspire to be able to do what they do not just in terms of the work itself, but the lifestyle they get to live, or the validation they have received from others.

They are big enough to matter, but not so big that you can’t connect with them.

Look for those who are advocates for the type of work you do. This could be as formal as media (newspapers, bloggers, podcasters), but as informal

Who shows up to conferences or events, workshops, and online chats? Whom does your ideal audience already know and respect in their field?

A particularly good place to find mid-level doers is podcasts in your field. The podcaster themselves is someone you should focus on

The list of people interviewed is a great place to begin in identifying additional mid-level doers.

# See other creators as collaborators not competitors

Don’t treat other creators as “competition.” View them instead as like-minded people who share the same passion that you do for this work and how it affects the world. Their experiences can shave years off your own journey in setting up your gateway and carving a path to it.

Instead of feeling envy or jealousy of others, I would encourage you to overwhelm them with kindness.

# Use social media for research

think of social media as the greatest research tool ever created.

observe and listen intently, and in doing so, better understand the people who will walk through your gateway. Use social media as an input, not an output.

Find your mid-level doers on every social media channel you can.

noticing which channels seem to be more popular for your creative field.

Observe which channels the mid-level doers are most active on, and have the most followers on, and then follow them there.

identify the one or two that really matter to them. Focus on those.

begin recognizing the practices that work for those in your field

see who they follow

See who these mid-level doers mention often in their social media feeds.

observe any @names that the person mentions again and again in their feeds. Look for names and faces.

look at who follows these mid-level doers, but also see who mentions them, by searching their @name in the search field for each social network.

Give yourself a week or two, and simply listen. Look at every social media update they share.

focus on the people and what they engage with. Let go of your assumptions and your own narratives here.

use a wide range of communication channels and methods, not just one social network.

# Meet people in person and ask questions

focus your attention on the attendees. Talk to them.

Ask people why they came. Ask about what kind of work they love and why. Ask how they got into this field. Don’t try to impress people, and don’t try to sound too smart or savvy. Whatever you do, don’t promote your own work.

consider reaching out to those mid-level doers you identified. Ask simple questions that you need help with.

# Look at brands as made up of people

If there are brands or media that you feel your audience knows and respects, I would encourage you to not think of them as publicity channels for your work, but instead as people with a shared passion.

Learn how the organization is structured, how many people are within it, and where they are located. For your specific field, see if there is a subgroup that specializes in it.

Stop pitching blindly to “entities” and start understanding these organizations as real groups of multifaceted people, who are just like you.

If you want to have a better sense of how marketing works within a big publisher, look these people up on LinkedIn.

do research to see what these departments and individuals truly look like.

Go to bookstores and befriend people there.

# Use the Least Crowded Channel

Look for the people who surround the mid-level doer, such as a manager, an assistant, the support staff. If you are attending an event that one of your heroes is putting on, befriend all the people who are working on it.

You can do this via email (send questions, receive back answers), Skype for an online video interview, phone, or meet in person.

# Interview people

interviewing the mid-level doers, the members of the communities you hope to engage, and the people who are fans of work similar to yours.

it also helps you understand the needs of your community.

you are creating maps. You are learning the existing paths, the people you need to know, the language your audience understands, and how to use that to connect your work to your ideal audience.

putting in the time to understand the communities they hope to be a part of. The core focus here is to consider the people who make up these communities, and create relationships with them.

Consider not how you can gain the attention of others, but how you can bring joy to them, and develop meaningful connections over time, because what lasts is what you create

# Dedicate yourself to being present with others

being someone who is there when they need to experience joy, when they need to learn, when they need a helping hand, and when they simply need to know that there is hope. What lasts isn’t instant success, but that inclination to be present for others.

# How to find and use the right channels

When choosing the channels you invest in to reach your audience, it should be a mixture of online and offline channels

use your research to determine the channels where your ideal audience is most engaged.

popular channels where your audience engages versus “the least crowded channel.” You should instead use both strategies in different ways, at different times.

# How to build a website

If you are creating a website for yourself, do a survey of ten colleagues to see what their sites look like. Then, for your own, I would encourage you to keep it as simple as possible in terms of both content and design.

identify the core things it has to do and include only those. Include as few items on the navigation bar as possible; write in the first person and not in the third person to directly address those who do come

Simply be aware whether you are focusing your audience’s attention, or splitting it.

Be clear about what the main gateway represents, and why they would want to enter.

Consider whether you will create long-form content.

# Use both a blog and a newsletter

Consider the difference between a blog and an email newsletter as “pull” versus “push.” With “pull,” you are hoping to pull your audience back to your blog again and again. You are relying on them remembering to come back

email newsletters are a nice way to “push” your content out to those who choose to receive it. They receive an email the exact moment you want them to

# How to use social media

You can share your content, aggregate content from others, post status updates on what you are doing (professionally or personally) and, of course, directly engage with others.

Don’t just constantly share updates about your services and intrude on others’ lives. Instead, use social media meaningfully. Engage in real conversations, showcase your purpose and your process, and celebrate others who care about the same type of work you do.

# Use research to craft social media posts that give your audience what they want to feel

focus on topics that you uncovered in the research earlier in this chapter, but also focus on the feelings that you give people.

understand the feelings people want to have

be inventive

To have people understand your work, you will need to become a student of those you hope to reach.

# Tell other people's stories too

Generosity—with your time and attention, your talent and your enthusiasm—is a core way to engage others. If you do something such as an email newsletter, use it to tell other people’s stories as it relates to your vision, not just your own experience.

# Actively direct people to your gate

Don’t wait for people to find and walk through your gateway on their own. Instead, one by one, bring people to your gateway and assist them in walking through it.

# Share your work like you're sharing to a friend

Sharing should be a process that involves others: one that is social, and one that feels as natural as a conversation with a close friend.

tell them about your process, what motivated you, the roadblocks, and so much else about what drives you.

Sharing the journey is about developing advocates around your creative work that lead to word-of-mouth marketing.

Stop being distant and professional.

Write in the first person.

Share proper status updates that include the complex reality of your life.

Show enthusiasm for other people's work.

# Your creative work and readers are more important that your ego, identity, image, and metrics

With your creative work, what matters is the work itself, how you have grown as a person as you develop your craft, and how your work affects the lives of others.

# The four S

1. Seek out others.
2. Signal to others that you are like them, and are welcoming a chance to engage.
3. Share things that represent your message.
4. Shape conversations by asking questions.

# Share emotions that drive you

share the emotion you want others to feel when they experience your work. This practice focuses on experiences, not “things.”

these do not need to be positive emotions.

Emotions of any kind act as a signal and give people a way in.

# Find models outside your field

look for people whose work you admire who also share behind-the-scenes examples of how they have grown their career.

# Treat your audience like royalty no matter how few they are

if you have sixty followers, treat them like the most special people in the world. They are the foundation for how your work will reach more people, and impact the world.

# How to engage with your audience one on one

Connect with one new person per week. Take them out to lunch, email them, or set up a phone call.

focus on engaging more with the top ten percent, those who seem to be more supportive.

Send an email to a colleague—a mid-level doer who practices the same craft you do—and thank them for how their work inspired you.

Interview those who do what you would love to do. You can ask them everything you ever worried about in your own work, but also share the interview to promote them and become aligned with them publicly.

# Develop a support system

identify collaborators

surround yourself with people who understand your work and trust you as a person

ensure your creative vision spreads

Consider how each person you connect with becomes a collaborator—someone who is part of your creative process

For collaborators, start small but intentional.

You simply need someone who can be a sounding board when you have questions, and keep you on track and accountable.

If you want someone to help answer questions, you have to be clear and concise in what you ask, and you have to actually be willing to act on that person’s advice. If you want someone to keep you accountable, you have to illustrate to them that you will do the work, even in the moments they aren’t prodding you.

embrace collaborators early in your process so you can learn what truly engages an audience.

# Find mentors

shadow them, apprentice with them, or meet once per month

consider informal mentorships. Identifying people in your life who you can check in with on a regular basis, but without them having to agree to officially be a mentor for you.

For every second email, ask a simple question that you could use their input on.

asks nothing, but gives quite a bit

the small things you do ask for are framed in a way that illustrates the impact that they will make

# Establish a mastermind group

Small group mastermind
- Each person was allocated one-fourth of the call (20-30 minutes) to tell the group about a specific challenge they had or a goal they were working toward. The rest of their time was spent brainstorming ideas and ways of helping them navigate.

One-on-one mastermind
- speak weekly via the phone, and devote one call to her challenges and one to mine.

Managed mastermind group
- one person acts as the leader of the group and actively manages the group by giving prompts, sharing ideas, and encouraging collaboration.
- members come from different creative fields, have different goals, and are asked to hone in on specific challenges and goals they need assistance with.
- run these groups entirely online using a group chat program and videos.
- members have the ability to chat and post updates 24/7

# How collaborators, mentors, and masterminds help you

helping you better understand those you want to reach and how to effectively communicate and engage with those people.
