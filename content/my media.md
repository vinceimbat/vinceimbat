My main medium is [[writing]]. The genre I want most to master is the [[personal essay]], specifically, the contemplative personal essay and the spiritual personal essay.

I like my essays to combine the following:
- personal stories
- philosophical inquiries
- landscape descriptions
- poems
- quotations
- translations
- photos
- research
- general narratives and stories

The second writing genre I want to master is [[poetry]].

My secondary medium is [[photography]].
