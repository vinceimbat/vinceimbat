The [[Five areas of my life work]] are further categorized between [[Inner work vs. outer work]]. My inner work consists of [[thoughts/understanding]] and [[thoughts/living]]. These two are the core of my life work.

Understanding, the practice of the mind, allows the emergence and articulation of my [[thoughts/my vision statement|vision]]. This vision, in turn, inspires everything I do, including my [[thoughts/poetry]], [[Photography]], and [[thoughts/writing]]. Everything becomes easier when understanding is nurtured and I nurture it through [[thoughts/philosophy]].

Meanwhile, living helps counterbalance and check understanding. It is the arena where experimentation becomes possible. [[thoughts/understanding mainly informs action]]â€”to act appropriately moment to moment (see [[Pragmatism]]; [[Understanding leads to compassion]]).

If I am able to inform my life through understanding and enhance my life's meaning through this process, I have succeeded.
