[[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] initially wanted to revive the [[unitarianism|Unitarian]] Church through[[ kiitsu kyokai]] but he realized that what is needed is a continuation of the church through a significant transformation. What are these transformations?

- Imaoka wanted kiitsu kyokai to go beyond Christianity (i.e. [[unitarian-universalism|unitarian-universalism]]).
- He wanted it to be a [[jiyu shukyo]].
- He wanted it to be non-sectarian.
- He wanted it to be transdenominational (i.e., not being overly attached to established religions).
- He wanted this free religion to be the base from which we accept established religions if we choose so.
- He wanted it to respond to the needs of those who have faith in it rather than be "ready-made."
