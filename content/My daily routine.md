My daily objective is to nurture all [[My life areas]] but doing something for each. I assign each life area to a time block.

| Morning       | Afternoon and Evening |
| ------------- | --------------------- |
| Understanding | Overseeing            |
| Creating      | Sustaining            |
|               | Connecting            |
|               | Restoring             |

- If a project is available, open [[thoughts/things]] and perform a preplanned menu of actions (ideally prepared during the [[Weekly review]]).
