I am reminded to live my life with things unseen in my mind. Things unseen have the potential to stay here long after I'm gone: the kindness I've shown others, the words I've spoken or written, the memories I've created with others, and the love I've shown them.

I remember Chami, our dog. We lost her physically, but she stays alive in our hearts and mind. I remember how her coat was pale gray when she was a puppy. I remember how she was very afraid during her first ride on my father's car. I remember how Tita Bebot was so fond of her she wanted to bring her to the States. I remember how she gave birth and took care of Kako as a pup. She is no longer here but her life exceeds existence.

I think about this with the awareness that I, too, could die anytime. But to know that I could continue to be part of this world through memories as my physical body returns to the Earth, somehow, gives me some peace of mind and motivation to create as much positive memories as I could with othersâ€”to show love, kindness, and joy.
