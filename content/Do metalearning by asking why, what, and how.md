You perform a [[Metalearning]] project by asking three questions:

1. Why am I learning what I am learning?
2. What knowledge and abilities do I need to acquire?
3. How am I going to acquire the knowledge and abilities I need?

Answering these questions involve the following steps:
1. [[Articulate your motivation for learning to help you focus on what matters]].
2. [[Identify concepts, facts, and procedures to understand the knowledge structure of a subject]].
3. [[Analyze concepts, facts, and procedures to identify bottlenecks in your learning project]].
4. [[Apply benchmarking and emphasizing-excluding to know how to learn effectively]].
