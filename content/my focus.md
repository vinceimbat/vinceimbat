My focus is fulfilling [[my vision statement]] through [[my mission statement]]. To carve time for this focus, I shall do the following:

- All my outside-looking work will only feature subjects related to my vision and mission.
- I'll be more selective with my reading. My readings should support my vision and mission. I'll still be reading the works of my friends but on the sidelines.
- I'm officially putting aside doing masters on creative writing. I could consider taking a course if it helps me focus on my vision and mission.
