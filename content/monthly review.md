While the [[weekly review|weekly review]] is designed to maintain my [[ground level|ground level]] ([[my lms ground level setup|my lms ground level setup]]), the monthly review breaks this continuous focus on taking [[action|action]] and provides a space where I can evaluate my [[sky level|sky level]], most especially [[my life areas|my life areas]] and [[life goals|life goals]]. If this is its purpose, a seeming disconnect between what I do and what I would like to do is caused by a problem in my monthly review process. This is why I think reading my [[purpose statement|purpose statement]], [[my mission statement|my mission statement]], etc. is necessary during [[my monthly review routine|my monthly review routine]].

Another key difference between a weekly review and a monthly review is that a weekly review can be mostly tactical because the monthly review has already been strategic. If the weekly review helps me get things done, the monthly review ensures that I get the “right” things done. A monthly review assures that I maintain focus on my intentions ([[thoughts/focus is the force you exert to stay in line with your intentions|focus is the force you exert to stay in line with your intentions]]). Furthermore, it reminds me of my progress.

There are two artifacts produced by a monthly review: the [[monthly reports|monthly reports]] and [[uman|Uman]].
