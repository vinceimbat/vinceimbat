It is particularly hard to appreciate nature when you are used to many stimuli. Especially when there is not much to see or if one is in front of a seemingly unmoving mountain. One will be tempted to move on and look for something else to see.

This is why walking is meditation—a mindfulness practice of being present to things around oneself.

Gros, F. (2014). A Philosophy of Walking. Verso.

Walking, as they say, ‘empties the mind’. In another way, walking *fills* the mind with a different sense of purpose. Not connected with ideas or doctrines, not in the sense of a head full of phrases, quotations, theories: but full of the world’s presence. That presence which, during the walk, in successive strata, has been deposited in the soul throughout the day.
