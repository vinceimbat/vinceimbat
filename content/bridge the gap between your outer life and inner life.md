There is a disconnect between what I'm doing when alone and what I'm doing when I'm with others. The objective, therefore, is to bridge that gap.

I don't want to simply be a pawn, a cog in someone else's machine. I want to advocate my own thinkingâ€”connect the self with society and nature.

I can do that by directly sharing what I'm doing to others: the practices. And this is where writing as a public act still happens.

How can I move out without losing my self?

Teach using writing, videos, content. Build an audience. Then create a community. You don't have to force your friends to support you. Build your tribe the right way. If you need company while doing it, then tap your existing friends. But your friends are not your audience.
