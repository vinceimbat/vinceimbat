There are [[benefits of articulating your purpose]]. However, how a [[purpose]] is articulated determines how it is pursued and acted upon.

There are two ways of articulating purpose:
1. [[end state]]
2. repeating state

If, for example, you stated that your purpose is to become a dad, and by that you mean someone who has a child, you have articulated a final end state. When your wife bears a child, you have achieved the end state.
- Bad example. Replace.

On the other hand, if you said that your purpose is to be happy, you have articulated a repeating state whose repetition only ends when you are dead. This is because [[pursuing a mental state as a purpose requires reconstruction]].

When articulating purpose, it might be useful to remember the following guidelines:
- [[a purpose is not always a core desired mental state]].
- There is a difference between [[primary vs secondary purposes]].
- [[we create our individual purpose]].

Here are [[ways to create our individual purpose]].

Note: I wrote this note in 2021, and I need to review it closer to see where I still agree on it. My gut tells me this is too mechanical a way of thinking about purpose.
