There are [[Benefits of articulating your purpose]], but how a [[thoughts/purpose]] is articulated determines how it is pursued and acted upon.

There are two ways of articulating purpose:
1. [[End state]]
2. Repeating state

If, for example, you stated that your purpose is to become a dad, and by that you mean someone who has a child, you have articulated a final end state. When your wife bears a child, you have achieved the end state.

On the other hand, if you said that your purpose is to be happy, you have articulated a repeating state whose repetition only ends when you are dead. This is because [[To pursue a mental state as a purpose requires reconstruction]].

When articulating purpose, it might be useful to remember the following guidelines:
- [[A purpose is not always the same as a core desired mental state]]
- There is a difference between [[Primary vs secondary purposes]].
- [[We create our individual purpose]].
- [[Focus on feeling good and purpose will follow]].

Here are [[Ways to create our individual purpose]].
