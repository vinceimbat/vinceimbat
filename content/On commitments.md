Passion and mission projects have few risk for commitment

Sustenance is different. You have to commit because people are counting on u to provide value.

If I choose to be a renaissance man, I need to accept reality in terms of commitment and how this will affect my desire for reputation.

When it comes to making money or responding to an audience that is holding you accountable, one needs to commit more than when simply doing a project for the fun of it.

My secret goal is to enhance my freedom to change - that is, to do something with less intention to make money or less intention to impress so that I do it purely for its innate satisfaction and presence. Perhaps for me that is success.

Nevertheless, I also need some recognition and I need income without tying myself to the land. For income and recognition to be given I need to provide value enough for people to pay and follow me.
