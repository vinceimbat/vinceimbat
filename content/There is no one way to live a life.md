In the fantasy story I am developing, there is a single song that guides a collection of islands. But they later realize they do not need one song but many songsâ€”one song for each island. If there will be one advice for crafting that song, then it will be short:

Live your truth. Recognize that other people have their own way of living their life. It is no good use to force everyone into a single way of life.
