You can call yourself an expert if you already rely on embodied experience when doing your work. This means, you have a “feel” for the process. You know which task really matters.

In this state, you don’t rely on memory or conscious thinking. You act subconsciously. You rely on your intuition.

You have reached this state because you have repeatedly exposed yourself to numerous feedback loops allowed by the design of your workflow ([[A circular workflow allows for many feedback loops]]).

This intuition that experts enjoy is what leads to new insights.

This shows that [[Intuition is not mysterious nor the opposite of rationality]].
