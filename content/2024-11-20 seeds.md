LB is suburban. If one needs to be reminded of the monotony of modern life, one needs to stay at home or go to grove or Manila South Road. Walking at Lopez. But even in these places there are reminders of the clearing (a sidewalk at Pili Drive broken by natural movement of soil) that reminds me of who I could become outside of the monotony.
