# Question: How can I incorporate prayer?

Reasons why I want to incorporate
- Praying to Jehovah was once a very powerful experience.
- I sometimes feel like I want to talk with someone.
- I once talked to my deceased friend.

What I've explored so far.
- Prayer as something un-addressed to anyone (from Spirituality for the Godless by Michael McGhee). But how can this be done?
- Prayer as listening (from your blog post about [[gary whited|Gary Whited]] and [[leo tolstoy|Leo Tolstoy]]).
- Prayers as addressed to others (as in [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka's]] prayer.)

What are other options?
