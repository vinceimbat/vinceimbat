Part of what fulfills that purpose is curating my environment in a way that optimizes Ginhawa ([[Enhance the experience of a mental state by modifying the environment]]).

I would like to see a world full of [[Love]] and [[Freedom]] ([[Freedom leads to Ginhawa]], [[Freedom is an essential prerequisite for optimal Ginhawa]]). I want to see more individuals valuing these. I want to see more institutional systems built for these. However, I want this love and freedom to be grounded in [[Truth]].

Through my work, I would be able to create systems and practices built on good thinking that other people can use to practice Ginhawa in their lives.

My mission is a big personal development project.

To do

- Need to do more reflection and thinking about this.
