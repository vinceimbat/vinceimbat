# Summary

In July, I met my Pangasinan writing colleagues for the first time in the event [[pangasinan literature and nation|Pangasinan, Literature, and Nation]] in Urdaneta. The event inspired me to deepen my commitments in supporting the Pangasinan writing community's initiatives. The video clips I shared of the event also stirred conversations in social media. My increased involvement with the Pangasinan writing community climaxed when I submitted a proposal for the creation of a Pangasinan writers group within UPSP and a proposal for NCCA granting for the first writers workshop purely in the Pangasinan language.

En route back home to Los Baños, I stayed a couple of days at Manila to meet with Ton and get my books and put a close to my BIR resolution project. While there, I got to walk at Pasay Bay walk, visit the large Fully Booked branch at SM MOA, have lunch at Yabu, visit the Solidaridad Bookshop, and walk around Luneta Park for the first time.

July was also a month of rethinking my relationship with my writing. This was prompted in part by Jesa's advice to create first and submit latter. I reviewed and revised [[my poetics]] and [[my quest]]. I decided to review my quest after re-reading the chapter [[protheus seybold|Protheus]] in Ethel Seybold's book, which is about Thoreau's quest.

While all of these were underway, I also launched my first zine and collaboration project called "So We Must Meet Apart." Through the project, I learned how to produce and sell a zine. This July, we also invited our first guests in our improved house. I also met and helped Jayson, who helped me put in perspective the amount of money I make from the zine.
