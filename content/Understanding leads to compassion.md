In my life work, one of the [[Five areas of my life work]] is [[thoughts/understanding]]. [[thoughts/understanding mainly informs action]]. When I study, the goal is usually to understand a specific situation so that I know how to act in it. I don't study just for the sake of knowing or to decorate myself. My studies are like [[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]].

When we [[thoughts/see things as they really are]], we begin to understand. That understanding usually involves perceiving the suffering in others no matter who they are or how they behaved towards us. When we achieve understanding, we usually act from [[thoughts/compassion]]. Consequently, [[Compassion leads to happiness]].
