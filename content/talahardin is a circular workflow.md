[[talahardin|Talahardin]] is a circular workflow ([[a circular workflow allows for many feedback loops]]). That is because, when you write your thoughts or the thoughts of others via what you read, you realize how much you have really thought about them. And when you integrate a new idea by comparing it with existing notes or when you [[fill permanent notes with links to other notes]], you see the gaps in your thinking via contradictions, inconsistencies, and repetitions.

Feedback from readers is still important, but the the feedback you get when you [[use a note-writing system]] is available every moment of every day. What's more, when we use this circular workflow regularly and [[combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice]], you [[grow the talahardin to complexity]].
