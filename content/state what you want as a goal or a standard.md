Stating what you want is important in [[thoughts/goal-setting]]. A [[goal]] is simply a statement of what you want, an [[end state]] you desire.

There are two ways to express what you want:

1. State it as a one-time goal achievable through a [[project]].
2. State it as a continuous [[Standard]] of an [[life area]] that is maintained through [[habits]] and [[routines]].

While [[tiago forte]] argues that standards cannot be articulated, only felt, I believe that [[an area standard can be articulated]] simply because it is a recurring end state.
