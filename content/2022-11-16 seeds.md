Somehow, I have been very privileged in my lot. I am able to do philosophy and contemplation relatively with ease because of the job that I "had." But perhaps it isn't impossible and perhaps things will even be more interesting in keeping a philo and contemplative practice while also in the trenches of a work.

Or is it time to combine the two or find something more aligned?

If there seems to be lots of advantages sourced from believing. Is there also advantages for disbelieving? I still haven't found confidence in myself.
