[[The present moment is only what truly exists]]. And among all forms of art, I think photography is the closest to the present moment because it uses the exact imagesâ€”the most direct of all media. You point, click, capture, and you have everything you need. No words or explanations needed. In this case, [[photography is mindfulness training]].

[[Poetry]] comes in second place not because it accurately captures what exists in the moment but because [[Poetry celebrates the present moment]]. It reminds us of what will never come back and makes use of the resources of the present moment.
