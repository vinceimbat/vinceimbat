Sharing your process and journey is how you tell others to follow a path that leads to your gateway, which is what people seek.

Here are the benefits of sharing your process:
- It makes people feel that they are part of your process.
- It builds advocates connected to your work in a personal way that will help spread your work.
- It makes you aware of how your daily life aligns to your creative work, holding you accountable.
