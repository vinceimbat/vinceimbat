This afternoon  
under a drizzling gray sky  
I buried a kittenâ€”  
a kitten I fed this morning  

A kitten I picked up yesterday  
as I was walking under a sunny sky  
whose cries my ears could not ignore  
whose desolate thrownness pierced my heart 

A kitten whose eyes, ears, and fur I cleaned  
from all the fly eggs that covered them  
like tiny grains of rice  
that smelled like rotten fish  

A kitten who slept silently  
beside the warm bottle of water  
I placed over the old towel inside the carrier  
where she rested a full day of sleep.  

I fed her this morning  
gave her a name  
thought of beautiful thoughts of our future  
thought of telling my friends about her  

But this beautiful thing was thrown twice  
first by God  
and a second time by man  
just a few days after being born.  

Not many of us could have survived that.  
No, not this kitten  
not this beautiful thing  
that this world is too vicious for.  

I buried a kitten under a hole I dug  
with a shovel I borrowed in a lawn I don't own
there amongst the grass  
and all other things thrown.
