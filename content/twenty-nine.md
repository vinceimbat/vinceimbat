A gift is something  
you didn't ask for  
but was given to you.

I didn't ask for this  
but I am here now  
breathing  
after all these years.  
A gift.

A miracle is something  
that shouldn't have happened  
but it did.  
What were the odds  
that I'll be born  
in 1992  
a boy  
in the Philippines  
only to meet you?  
A miracle.

A mystery is a question  
with no clear answer  
or a fact  
that bewilders and awes.

Why am I here?  
Where did I come from?  
Where am I going?  
How should I live?  
A mystery
