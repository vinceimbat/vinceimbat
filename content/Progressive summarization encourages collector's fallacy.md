[[thoughts/tiago forte]] overemphasizes highlighting. His [[Progressive summarization]] method encourages making highlights indiscriminately. And him encouraging the use of highlighting tools like Liner and Readwise amplifies this. He separates the process of making highlights and taking notes per [[getting things done]]. [[Christian Tietze]] and [[Andy Matuschak]] does the same, but they are cautious that they spend more time in processing than collecting. Tiago doesnâ€™t seem to share this precaution. For him, it is okay to read on the phone wherever you go as long you can make highlights, which you'll return to anyway.
