After Vincenz Serrano sent me the syllable of his class on walking at Ateneo, I asked him, if I'm going to read just one book on the list of references on walking, which is it? He replied, Rebecca Solnit's A History of Walking.

The ebook has been sitting in my computer for god knows how long so I'm glad I now have a very good reason to start reading it.

In the book, at least where I am right now, Rebecca criticizes Thoreau (who introduced me to walking) along with the entire canon of walking literature. Rebecca argues that the Western walking literature is basically a sausage party that fetishizes rural walking with nature as object. And then she introduces alternative forms of walking, which are less motivated by a desire to romanticize nature and which women have also participated in. One of these forms is urban walking, a "messier" way to walk but one that was not bound to the moralizing tendencies of nature and rural walks.

The most obvious and the most obscure thing in the world, this walking that wanders so readily into religion, philosophy, landscape, urban policy, anatomy, allegory, and heartbreak.

**The history of walking is an unwritten, secret history whose fragments can be found in a thousand unemphatic passages** in books, as well as in songs, streets, and almost everyone’s adventures. The bodily history of walking is that of bipedal evolution and human anatomy.

**Most of the time walking is merely practical, the unconsidered locomotive means between two sites.**

To make walking into an investigation, a ritual, a meditation, is a special subset of walking

**the subject of walking is, in some sense, about how we invest universal acts with particular meanings.**

history of the imagination and the culture, of **what kind of pleasure, freedom, and meaning are pursued at different times by different kinds of walks and walkers.**

That **imagination has both shaped and been shaped by the spaces it passes through on two feet.**

Walking has created paths, roads, trade routes; generated local and cross-continental senses of place; shaped cities, parks; generated maps, guidebooks, gear, and, further afield, a vast library of walking stories and poems, of pilgrimages, mountaineering expeditions, meanders, and summer picnics.

The landscapes, urban and rural, gestate the stories, and the stories bring us back to the sites of this history.

This history of walking is an amateur history, just as walking is an amateur act.

it trespasses through everybody else’s field—through anatomy, anthropology, architecture, gardening, geography, political and cultural history, literature, sexuality, religious studies—and doesn’t stop in any of them on its long route. For if a field of expertise can be imagined as a real field—a nice rectangular confine carefully tilled and yielding a specific crop—then **the subject of walking resembles walking itself in its lack of confines.**

though the history of walking is, as part of all these fields and everyone’s experience, virtually infinite, **this history of walking I am writing can only be partial, an idiosyncratic path traced through them by one walker**, with much doubling back and looking around.

The history of walking is everyone’s history, and any written version can only hope to indicate some of the more well-trodden paths in the author’s vicinity—which is to say, **the paths I trace are not the only paths.**

I sat down one spring day to write about walking and stood up again, because **a desk is no place to think on the large scale.**

thinking is generally thought of as doing nothing in a production-oriented culture, and doing nothing is hard to do. It’s best done by disguising it as doing something, and **the something closest to doing nothing is walking**.

**Walking itself is the intentional act closest to the unwilled rhythms of the body, to breathing and the beating of the heart.**

It strikes a delicate balance between working and idling, being and doing. It is a bodily labor that produces nothing but thoughts, experiences, arrivals.

**Walking, ideally, is a state in which the mind, the body, and the world are aligned**, as though they were three characters finally in conversation together, three notes suddenly making a chord. Walking allows us to be in our bodies and in the world without being made busy by them. It leaves us free to think without being wholly lost in our thoughts.

**Moving on foot seems to make it easier to move in time; the mind wanders from plans to recollections to observations.**

**The rhythm of walking generates a kind of rhythm of thinking, and the passage through a landscape echoes or stimulates the passage through a series of thoughts. This creates an odd consonance between internal and external passage, one that suggests that the mind is also a landscape of sorts and that walking is one way to traverse it.**

A new thought often seems like a feature of the landscape that was there all along, as though thinking were traveling rather than making.

one aspect of the history of walking is the history of thinking made concrete—for the motions of the mind cannot be traced, but those of the feet can.

**Walking can also be imagined as a visual activity, every walk a tour leisurely enough both to see and to think over the sights, to assimilate the new into the known.** Perhaps this is where walking’s peculiar utility for thinkers comes from.

The surprises, liberations, and clarifications of travel can sometimes be garnered by going around the block as well as going around the world, and walking travels both near and far.

**perhaps walking should be called movement, not travel, for one can walk in circles or travel around the world immobilized in a seat**, and a certain kind of wanderlust can only be assuaged by the acts of the body itself in motion

**It is the movement as well as the sights going by that seems to make things happen in the mind**, and this is what makes walking ambiguous and endlessly fertile: it is both means and end, travel and destination.

people like me who are heirs to the cultural tradition of walking in the landscape for pleasure.

The form our demonstrations took was walking: what was on the public-land side of the fence a ceremonious procession became, on the off-limits side, an act of trespass resulting in arrest. We were engaging, on an unprecedentedly grand scale, in civil disobedience or civil resistance, an American tradition first articulated by Thoreau.

Page 10

Thoreau himself was both a poet of nature and a critic of society.

In our actions at the test site the poetry of nature and criticism of society were united in this camping, walking, and trespassing, as though we had figured out how a berrying party could be a revolutionary cadre. It was a revelation to me, the way this act of walking through a desert and across a cattle guard into the forbidden zone could articulate political meaning.

I began to discover other western landscapes beyond my coastal region and to explore those landscapes and the histories that had brought me to them—the history not only of the development of the West but of the Romantic taste for walking and landscape, the democratic tradition of resistance and revolution, the more ancient history of pilgrimage and walking to achieve spiritual goals. **I found my voice as a writer in describing all the layers of history that shaped my experiences at the test site.** And I began to think and to write about walking in the course of writing about places and their histories.

Of course walking, as any reader of Thoreau’s essay “Walking” knows, inevitably leads into other subjects. Walking is a subject that is always straying.

Although I came to think about walking, I couldn’t stop thinking about everything else

There was a joy, she said, to finding that her body was adequate to get her where she was going, and it was a gift to develop a more tangible, concrete relationship to her neighborhood and its residents. We talked about the more stately sense of time one has afoot and on public transit, where things must be planned and scheduled beforehand, rather than rushed through at the last minute, and about the sense of place that can only be gained on foot.

**On foot everything stays connected, for while walking one occupies the spaces between those interiors in the same way one occupies those interiors. One lives in the whole world rather than in interiors built up against it.**

wandering in a book or a computer takes place within more constricted and less sensual parameters.

**It’s the unpredictable incidents between official events that add up to a life, the incalculable that gives it value.**

Both rural and urban walking have for two centuries been prime ways of exploring the unpredictable and the incalculable, but they are now under assault on many fronts.

I like walking because it is slow, and I suspect that the mind, like the feet, works at about three miles an hour. If this is so, then modern life is moving faster than the speed of thought, or thoughtfulness.

**Walking is about being outside, in public space, and public space is also being abandoned and eroded in older cities, eclipsed by technologies and services that don’t require leaving home, and shadowed by fear in many places (and strange places are always more frightening than known ones, so the less one wanders the city the more alarming it seems, while the fewer the wanderers the more lonely and dangerous it really becomes).**

**in many new places, public space isn’t even in the design: what was once public space is designed to accommodate the privacy of automobiles; malls replace main streets; streets have no sidewalks; buildings are entered through their garages; city halls have no plazas; and everything has walls, bars, gates. Fear has created a whole style of architecture and urban design**

**to be a pedestrian is to be under suspicion in many of the subdivisions and gated “communities.”**

rural land and the once-inviting peripheries of towns are being swallowed up in car-commuter subdivisions and otherwise sequestered.

In some places it is no longer possible to be out in public, a crisis both for the private epiphanies of the solitary stroller and for public space’s democratic functions.

Page 11

**when public space disappears, so does the body**

**The random, the unscreened, allows you to find what you don’t know you are looking for, and you don’t know a place until it surprises you.**

**Walking is one way of maintaining a bulwark against this erosion of the mind, the body, the landscape, and the city, and every walker is a guard on patrol to protect the ineffable.**

**If there is a history of walking, then it too has come to a place where the road falls off, a place where there is no public space and the landscape is being paved over, where leisure is shrinking and being crushed under the anxiety to produce, where bodies are not in the world but only indoors in cars and buildings, and an apotheosis of speed makes those bodies seem anachronistic or feeble. In this context, walking is a subversive detour, the scenic route through a half-abandoned landscape of ideas and experiences.**

My circuit was almost finished, and at the end of it I knew what my subject was and how to address it in a way I had not six miles before. It had come to me not in a sudden epiphany but with a gradual sureness, a sense of meaning like a sense of place.

**When you give yourself to places, they give you yourself back; the more one comes to know them, the more one seeds them with the invisible crop of memories and associations that will be waiting for you when you come back, while new places offer up new thoughts, new possibilities.**

Exploring the world is one of the best ways of exploring the mind, and walking travels both terrains.

# Highlights I can use in the Buhian essay

Walking as pilgrimage (78)
>A path is a prior interpretation of the best way to traverse a landscape, and to follow a route is to accept an interpretation, or to stalk your predecessors on it as scholars and trackers and pilgrims do. To walk the same way is to reiterate something deep; to move through the same space the same way is a means of becoming the same person, thinking the same thoughts.

Why narrative and walking come together (81–82)
>Like the stations of the cross, the labyrinth and maze offer up stories we can walk into to inhabit bodily, stories we trace with our feet as well as our eyes. There is a resemblance not only between these symbolically invested structures but between every path and every story. Part of what makes roads, trails, and paths so unique as built structures is that they cannot be perceived as a whole all at once by a sendentary onlooker. They unfold in time as one travels along them, just as a story does as one listens or reads, and a hairpin turn is like a plot twist, a steep ascent a building of suspense to the view at the summit, a fork in the road an introduction of a new storyline, arrival the end of the story.
>
>Just as writing allows one to read the words of someone who is absent, so roads make it possible to trace the route of the absent. Roads are a record of those who have gone before, and to follow them is to follow people who are no longer there.
>
>To write is to carve a new path through the terrain of the imagination, or to point out new features on a familiar route. To read is to travel through that terrain with the author as guide—a guide one may not always agree with or trust, but who can at least be counted upon to take one somewhere. 

Songlines as tools of navigation (82)
>The songlines of Australia’s aboriginal peoples are the most famous examples conflating landscape and narrative. The songlines are tools of navigation across the deep desert, while the landscape is a mnemonic device for remembering the stories: in other words, the story is a map, the landscape a narrative.

==Ang mga tula ay mapa, ang

Why we need to connect the products of the mind with space (82)
>The workings of the mind and the spirit are hard to imagine, as is the nature of time—so we tend to metaphorize all these intangibles as physical objects located in space. Thus our relationship to them becomes physical and spatial: we move toward or away from them.

Place, walking, and memory (86)
>There is a very practical sense in which to trace even an imaginary route is to trace the spirit or thought of what passed there before. At its most casual, this retracing allows unsought memories of events to return as one encounters the sites of those events. At its most formal it is a means of memorizing.
>
>Memory, like the mind and time, is unimaginable without physical dimensions; to imagine it as a physical place is to make it into a landscape in which its contents are located, and what has location can be approached. That is to say, if memory is imagined as a real space—a place, theater, library—then the act of remembering is imagined as a real act, that is, as a physical act: as walking.
>
>To walk the same route again can mean to think the same thoughts again, as though thoughts and ideas were indeed fixed objects in a landscape one need only know how to travel through. In this way, walking is reading, even when both the walking and reading are imaginary, and the landscape of the memory becomes a text.

Books that resemble walks
>But if the book has eclipsed the memory palace as a repository of information, it has retained some of its pattern. In other words, if there are walks that resemble books, there are also books that resemble walks and use the “reading” activity of walking to describe a world. The greatest example is Dante’s Divine Comedy, in which the three realms of the soul after death are explored by Dante, guided by Virgil.
