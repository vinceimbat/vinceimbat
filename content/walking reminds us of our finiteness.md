At every step, walking connects us with the earth. It reminds us of our finiteness by making us aware that we are bodies nailed to the ground.

In Gros’ words: “Walking is an invitation to die standing up."

Walking projects are time-bound as are all projects. But there is always the risk that one may no longer walk either through sickness, disability, or old age. And so to do a walking project is to be reminded of one's mortality. One balances presence and hastiness.
