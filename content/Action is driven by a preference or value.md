The central and foundational question about organizing society is whether to let the individual dictate his or her destiny or change him or her for any other reason.

In this way, in terms of treating others, metaphysics is irrelevant. Because even if something is true, forcing others to believe it is a separate question altogether.

In dealing with others and relating to them, we cannot be neutral. There will always be a necessary value. Freedom is a value. A value-less observation might be possible. But action is always value-filled. There is a purpose why you do something.

Now that value is not objective or absolute. It is subjective.

Anarchy therefore cannot escape that campaigning way of life. Like other ideologies, it has to be promoted and defended if it has any chance of being adopted.
