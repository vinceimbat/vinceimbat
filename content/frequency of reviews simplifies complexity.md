Life is super complex (see [[planning an entire life is impossible]]). Our [[life management system]] needs to be simple to accommodate our mind's limitations (see [[a life management system should free your mind]]; [[build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]]). But it shouldn't be very simple that it fails to accommodate complexity.

Complexity should be allowed in a life management system. And visual reminders of the complexity should exist lest we forget about this fact.

But the frequency of reviews simplifies life’s complexity. I cannot handle the entire complexity in one moment. But I can do so in different moments scattered across intervals.

This is [[design]]. Design allows for an efficient life system, one where actions are managed and are in integrity with higher-level convergence tools like [[purpose]] and [[goal]]s.

- "And visual reminders of the complexity should exist lest we forget about this fact.” What do you mean by this?
