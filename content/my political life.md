I grew up apolitical. It wasn't until around 19 years old when I left the [[jw|JWs]] that I began thinking about the possibility of having a political position. And even then it felt weird. Being an outsider stays with you. I was skeptical about [[politics]] even after I left my [[religion]]. I identified with the Left and joined a political party during my last year and a half at [[upb|UPB]]. I voted only once [[I want to dedicate the large portion of my life within.]]

Confession: [[anarchism]] appealed to me so much that for a short time I even felt like I approved of [[anarcho-capitalism]]. I no longer believe in this perspective.

Being a writer in the Philippines means that if you don't have a political position—if you are apolitical—you are scorned. I responded with this challenge by allowing myself to read widely, listen and befriend fellow writers with strong political positions. For example, writing [[so we must meet apart]] with [[jesa suganob|Jesa Suganob]] was personally tough because I had to dialogue with someone adept with her political views.
