A plan makes you inflexible. It requires you to exert willpower, which is demotivating and incongruent with the open-ended process of thinking. [[Thinking must produce insight]]. You cannot force the arrival of insight nor direct it towards a preconceived path. [[Insight cannot be predetermined]].

Thinking requires that you adjust your next actions based on new insight, which arrives frequently but not according to schedule. This constant adjustment means that you switch from one [[action]] to another when following an insight. It also means that you need to [[use curiosity to guide your thinking]].

[[Writing that aims at insight must be organized in a flexible system]]. Instead of a plan, you need a workflow that optimizes [[freedom]] ([[a good workflow optimizes freedom]]) because [[freedom motivates us]]. A workflow that involves a close cooperation with a collection of notes such as [[zettelkasten]] and [[talahardin]] is far superior than planning.

In a related note, even the [[natural planning model per allen|natural planning model]] outlined by [[David Allen]] is not really planning but an open-ended process.

# Questions

- Does this weaken the premise of planned learning, such as [[ultralearning]]?
