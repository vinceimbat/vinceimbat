If you are paid to do what you want and you can freely do anything and then you don't give an exact price to it, that is a gift.

Even if you are paid to do what you want but you out an exact price to it, it is still an exchange.

To do what you truly want and to offer that freely, accepting whatever others give you, is where the gift lies.

There are people for example who dont want to put a price on any of their work. Does this mean that they think about their work lowly? I dont think so. Some of these artists think their work is so good it transcends the exchange economy.
