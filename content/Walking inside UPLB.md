Before the latest community quarantine in this part of the country, I went out for walks almost every day inside the University of the Philippines (UP) campus. It is where one can really start to feel the character of Mt. Makilingâ€”trees start to get taller, bird songs become weirder, roads begin to ascend, and the wind starts to get colder.
