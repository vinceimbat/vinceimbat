Don't make this all about your conversion history. Just make this short for now. Let's make it about justifying the return to these places. Why return?

Answer: This is part of returning to where the sun warms. I tried my best to channel what I once felt while a JW to politics, secular life. But what really makes me feel warm is engaging with existential questions, thinking about the large questions, the big picture, and only then seeing how the things happening in my personal life and in the lives of the people I love and the situation of the country and the world I live in is connected. I feel warmth in spirituality, in religion, which is to say the merging of the cosmic and the personal. And so no matter how hard I tried to approach the world in a scholarly fashion, using theory and the things I learned in the university to interpret the world, this just didn't work for me. It's a cold way of approaching the world. Theory is okay but it has to help me feel warmth. For it to inspire me I have to extract the poetry out of it or if it lacks this, I need to use it to create poetry, which I'm using here liberally not to refer to the literary form but to the way of living and expressing one's thoughts and emotions, which resists predetermination. Cite Bernadete Meyer "Poetry is not having a master" (something).

This return to where the sun warms began around 2014, two years after I left the JWs. But it was simply characterized by an exploration of the spiritual and religious traditions of the "other." I was resisting returning to my past. In short, I was returning and attempting a return but it wasn't complete.

(Cite something your wrote in your journal about telling yourself oh I will return but in a different way.)

(My parents no longer talk to me about the past. We've reached the point where they've accepted my choice.)

To complete this return, I need to really return, to walk back to where things started. And this re-opening was opened by the walk to San Pablo City in 2022.

I am in Phase III and am on my way to completing my warm descent from the mountain.
- Interestingly, I had to do this beginning of my completion of return by going up a cold mountain.

"It again grows warmer around him, yellower, as it were; feeling and feeling for others acquire depth, warm breezes of all kinds blow across him. It seems to him as if his eyes are only now open to what is near. He is astonished and sits silent: where had he been? These near and nearest things: how changed they seem! what bloom and magic they have acquired!" â€” Friedrich Nietzsche
- I experienced this during the Baguio walk. Realizing that Aurora Hill and the Balili River were beautiful parts of the surroundings.
- ==Next project: To see Baguio not as a reservoir of the past but as a new reservoir for the present: to see it "as it is."
