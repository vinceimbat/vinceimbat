In 1886, in a new preface he wrote for his book *Human, All-Too-Human: A Book for Free Spirits*, Friedrich Nietzsche detailed a four-phased journey that a "free spirit" takes. In his book Waking to Wonder (1997), Gordon Bearn called these phases: hearth health, sickness, convalescence, and the great health of the free spirit. As the labels suggest, the journey describes a path to recovery from an illness, in this case, the great sickness of nihilism.[^1]
***
The free spirit begins her journey in a state of health, a health she acquires from being near the hearth (fireplace). In Filipino culture, the hearth is reminiscent of *dapog*, a stove made of mud that stands on three legs (*tungko*) and burns through firewood. The hearth also reminds me of the fire in the middle of a *dap-ay*, a gathering place for elders in many indigenous groups around the Philippines.

While the hearth provides health—a sense of purpose and security—for the free spirit in this first phase of her journey, Nietzsche says that she isn't truly "free" around it. In fact, Nietzsche says that a free spirit's peak moments while being around the hearth "fetter them the fastest, lay upon them the most enduring obligations." The hearth, therefore, is bondage.

Bearn says that the hearth symbolizes our inherited traditions, and our desire to be around the fire represents our "dutiful reverence" for our elders, country, and teachers. In religious terms, the hearth is the religious tradition we inherited from our family.
***
Nietzsche then pronounces that a sickness shall befall the free spirit, a sickness that suddenly uproots her from the hearth. The illness begins with a suspicion that the things that once gave purpose and security to her are, in fact, false. This suspicion later aggravates as hatred for everything that she once loved. As the illness progresses, she begins to consider that the things she once held "evil" are, in fact, "good." At its worst, nihilism envelopes the sick—she begins to believe that nothing matters, neither what was once good nor what was once evil. All of this was, of course, caused by the crumbling of the hearth.

In religious terms, the sickness of nihilism results from losing one's inherited religious tradition, which once explained the chaos inherent in the universe and provided purpose to one's life. Without it, the meaning of life is lost.
***
Sickness is followed by "long years of convalescence" in two phases. A cold detachment from the world characterizes the first phase of convalescence. The metaphor Nietzsche uses here is one of a soaring bird high above the sky. Still recovering from nihilism, the free spirit continues to be skeptical of almost everything. She neither loves nor hates things but sees them through a theoretical or scholarly gaze. At this point, the free spirit is already significantly distant from the hearth that none of the things there already matter, and the intense hatred she once felt toward it during her sickness is now tempered.

In this cold and distant phase, the free spirit is still partial to the idea that nothing matters, but she isn't too worried about it. Enjoying her newfound freedom away from everything else, she begins to smile.
***
But then, the free spirit realizes that soaring like a bird above all else will not complete her recovery. While flying away from the world below her, she begins to feel the coldness of a detached and stoic existence. She starts to notice a growing desire to feel the warmth of lower altitudes, "where the sun warms."

As the free spirit makes her descent, Nietzsche describes what she experiences:
>It again grows warmer around [her], yellower, as it were; feeling and feeling for others acquire depth, warm breezes of all kinds blow across [her]. It seems to [her] as if [her] eyes are only now open to what is near. [She] is astonished and sits silent: where had [she] been? These near and nearest things: how changed they seem! what bloom and magic they have acquired!

These things that she now sees, she sees them for the first time. These things were veiled during the cold phase of her convalescence and her sickness. But they were also hidden from her sight while in the hearth. Seeing these things and feeling the sun's warmth gives the free spirit a taste of "health" for the first time since her sickness.

In religious and metaphysical terms, the things that the free spirit sees for the first time during her descent represent the natural world itself, which, devoid of supernatural explanations and stripped of grand narratives, are finally seen as they really are.

Without a belief in a God or a large brother (or sister) in heaven, or perhaps even a mysterious inanimate force dictating the trajectory of your life, how would you see a flower for the very first time?

Nietzsche argues that without a metaphysical or supernatural foundation for the world, something that our inherited religious traditions provide, things (and our life, for that matter) are revealed for what they truly are—fragile and transient. And by virtue of their transience and fragility, they become more precious. We want to be nearer them. And this leads us to a newfound warmth, reminiscent but entirely different from the warmth of the hearth where we came from—a freeing warmth.
***
The last phase is "the great health of the spirit," which is simply warm convalescence prolonged. In this phase, the free spirit becomes comfortable with life outside the hearth—outside inherited religious and metaphysical traditions that require supernatural explanations and grand narratives.

She becomes attuned to being with a fragile universe yet learns a new kind of love. Per Bearn, this "different kind of love, producing a new happiness, is a love of what is precisely not immune to disaster, of what is delicate. This happiness, this great health, is a security within the shadow of risk, of fragility."

The free spirit grows healthy once more precisely because she is no longer afraid of the delicateness and impermanence of life. This fragility motivates her not to run cowering back to the hearth, back toward a God that would save her from it. Instead, this fragility motivates her to hold every moment of her life with love and care, knowing each could be her last.

Nietzsche introduced four phases of tragedy.

Gordon Bearn interpreted this in his book Waking to Wonder. The interpretation first came to me thru Andrew Brown.

(Brief summary.)

While walking back to Baguio esp returning to the large kh, I faced weird emotions. This got me thinking of thinking more of a rationale to these walks. Can I explain the necessity of these walks?

First: an attempt to apply the framework into my conversion history.

Why rewalking?

1. Seek reincorportation.
2. To see things nearby in a different light.
3. Letting go of metaphysics and trying to approach life more through art and living itself

Hey, Andrew cited Nietzsche not to tell people to abandon their belief in a God. He did so to tell people they can change their beliefs

Let's make it about justifying the return to these places. Why return?

Answer: This is part of returning to where the sun warms. I tried my best to channel what I once felt while a JW to politics, secular life. But what really makes me feel warm is engaging with existential questions, thinking about the large questions, the big picture, and only then seeing how the things happening in my personal life and in the lives of the people I love and the situation of the country and the world I live in is connected. I feel warmth in spirituality, in religion, which is to say the merging of the cosmic and the personal. And so no matter how hard I tried to approach the world in a scholarly fashion, using theory and the things I learned in the university to interpret the world, this just didn't work for me. It's a cold way of approaching the world. Theory is okay but it has to help me feel warmth. For it to inspire me I have to extract the poetry out of it or if it lacks this, I need to use it to create poetry, which I'm using here liberally not to refer to the literary form but to the way of living and expressing one's thoughts and emotions, which resists predetermination. Cite Bernadete Meyer "Poetry is not having a master" (something).

This return to where the sun warms began around 2014, two years after I left the JWs. But it was simply characterized by an exploration of the spiritual and religious traditions of the "other." I was resisting returning to my past. In short, I was returning and attempting a return but it wasn't complete.

(Cite something your wrote in your journal about telling yourself oh I will return but in a different way.)

(My parents no longer talk to me about the past. We've reached the point where they've accepted my choice.)

To complete this return, I need to really return, to walk back to where things started. And this re-opening was opened by the walk to San Pablo City in 2022.

I am in Phase III and am on my way to completing my warm descent from the mountain.
- Interestingly, I had to do this beginning of my completion of return by going up a cold mountain.

"It again grows warmer around him, yellower, as it were; feeling and feeling for others acquire depth, warm breezes of all kinds blow across him. It seems to him as if his eyes are only now open to what is near. He is astonished and sits silent: where had he been? These near and nearest things: how changed they seem! what bloom and magic they have acquired!" — Friedrich Nietzsche
- I experienced this during the Baguio walk. Realizing that Aurora Hill and the Balili River were beautiful parts of the surroundings.
- ==Next project: To see Baguio not as a reservoir of the past but as a new reservoir for the present: to see it "as it is."

Open with the memory of being lost in the middle of an assembly and finding Papa again.
