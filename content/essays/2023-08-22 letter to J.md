Dear J,

You said you walk the same paths but come to them a stranger every time. To me it is the other way around. The paths are strangers every time.

The cats for example in front Meister's come and go. The first clowder I met at that place when I arrived here was a petite calico, a bigger tilapia male cat and a smaller tilapia male kitten. Eventually the calico and the big tilapia left and the kitten grew by itself. I fed the cat as often as I can and would've adopted it if my vet didn't discourage me to do so. Stray cats will disrupt your clowder and bring disease esp to the older cats. I never brought Franco home even if I feel like we own eacj other.

One time while I was feeding him, a lady was watching and waiting. She had a bag of cat food too. I asked her if she was feeding the cat too. She said yes. I wasn't the only one that felt like I owned Franco. Perhaps nobody owns him and that means he survives.
