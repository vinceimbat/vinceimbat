[[uman|𝌡 Uman]] means “change.” It is a monthly newsletter I send every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life. It used to be a separate newsletter. But I've integrated it into [[templates/tlw|The Long Walk]]. Read the past issue [[essays/uman 2023-08|here]].
