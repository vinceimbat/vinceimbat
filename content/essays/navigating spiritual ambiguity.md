One of my friends asked me after reading my essay [[essays/traversing liminality through walking|Traversing Liminality Through Walking]] how I navigated myself out of spiritual ambiguity. Honestly, I don't think I have come out of ambiguity, but there are a couple of things that helped me navigate uncertainty in this area of my life.

The first was discovering the power of [[thoughts/presence is the foundation|presence]] and [[thoughts/meditation|meditation]]. These two things made me aware of what happens between my ears. They helped me realize that what I think is out of my control but it is what I pay attention to that I can control. Meditation gave me the tool to distance myself from my thoughts and, therefore, find peace. From this silence comes contemplation and all sorts of possibilities. I discovered that the more I stayed in the present moment, the less pain I feel.

The second thing that helped me navigate uncertainty was falling in love with [[thoughts/philosophy|philosophy]]. [[thoughts/purpose|Purpose]] is a big thing to me. Because I was suicidal. And when we are suicidal, it is purpose that saves us. Now, although I have a love-hate relationship with [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]] because it fosters hatred among people, it was seminal in finding a way out of despair.

I was constantly asking myself, what is my purpose? Or more specifically, what is the reason for me not to kill myself? Now, for many, the existence of [[thoughts/god|God]] is necessary to answer the question. I empathize with them. It is a popular and easy option, which is also logical. But it also means that there is a predetermined purpose for me.

The alternative, I discovered, is existentialism, which might seem bleak at first: [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless|life is inherently meaningless]]. Meaning does not arise from outside of us but inside of us. There is no large purpose behind the universe but that is okay. [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness|Meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]]. We can get by with the little meaning we are capable of creating. We can get going.

I could've killed myself in 2011 when the depression was really bad. But if I did that I may not have met the people I hold dear now and traveled all those places and experienced all those experiences. So looking back if the depression happens again and I am suicidal, I don't have to believe in God to continue going, I just have to remember that this life is so short anyway and I'll be gone soon but there's so much I want to do to make it meaningful and giving up now is a waste.

This is were [[thoughts/art|art]], specifically [[thoughts/writing|writing]], enters. For me, the arts is here to convince me not to kill myself. I can't kill myself now because there is so much more beauty to see and create. This keeps me going. Aside from this, [[thoughts/relationship|relationships]] are big too. Life is so much easier surrounded by good people.
