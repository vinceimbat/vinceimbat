What if you write the review like a narrative? Well, it requires more intentionality. The current setup allowa for bullet points and chunks of thought. But consider it.

So my main practice will be philosophy: contemplating to be decisive in the moment. The most important categories are studying and living. My measure of success is being sure about my actions, feeling good about my decisions, feeling like I am living with integrity. That I am being authentic and true. As long as I have that, I have succeeded.

Most of my days will be spent journaling, thinking, reading, and walking. And managing my life. Managing my life: my health, relationships, and finances, these are part of my daily work.

The question then is wht will I truly share? That would also be helpful to the world?
