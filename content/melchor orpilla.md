Melchor Orpilla is one of the pre-eminent scholars, writers, and advocates of the Pangasinan language. He is the author of [[laineng ed casborran orpilla|Laingen ed Casborran]]. Currently, he works at the Senior High School division of the Pangasinan State University while he serves as a part-time commissioner for the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino. Among all the writers I've read in Pangasinan, he has the widest vocabulary. I feel like he knows more words than most Pangasinenses who wrote dictionaries for the language.
