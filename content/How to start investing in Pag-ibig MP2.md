You need to be an active Pag-ibig member first. This means you have made at least 1 monthly contribution in the last 6 months. 

For the regular savings program, the minimum contribution is P100 with a maturity of 20 years where you receive all your money plus its interests.

You can also withdraw this money earlier.

MP2 has a maturity of 6 years an a 4-8% annual dividend rate.

Annual dividend = Ave. monthly balance x Dividend Rate

Pros
- Government-backed
- Tax free
- P500 minimum transaction. You don't have to deposit monthly.
- Multiple accounts online
- Open online

This is the safest investment with this much return.

You can withdraw dividends yearly or at the end of the 5 year maturity period. The latter is better.
