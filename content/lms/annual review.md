TO DO

- Include Tiago Forte's discussion on the use of annual reviews

The annual review is designed to work in unison with the [[lms/monthly review]], [[Weekly review]], and [[lms/daily review]]. [[lms/annual reports]] can only be created if [[lms/monthly reports]] for each year are religiously produced through consistent daily and weekly reviews.

An annual report is one of the products of the annual review. It is an aggregate of monthly reports and other data unique to the annual review. The purpose of the annual report is to help write the [[annual review article]].

Here is [[lms/my annual review routine]].
