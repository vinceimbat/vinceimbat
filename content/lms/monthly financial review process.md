# Updated Process

## 2023-11

1. Reconcile VF.
2. Reconcile CF.
3. Determine the total CF amount needed for the month.
	1. Put all remaining money from individual expenses back into "Ready to Assign."
	2. Calculate the total funds required by each expense.
	3. Deduct the number from step 1 from the number from step 2.
4. Divide this total CF amount by two.
5. Add Php 10,000 to Lea's share (for Vince's subsidy).
6. Deduct Php 10,000 from Vince's share.
7. Send Vince's share (from VF Next Month Fund or CF EF).
8. Determine total amount needed for other expenses under VF.
9. Fill other expenses under VF (from VF Next Month Fund or CF EF).
10. Send Lea's share (from LF Next Month Fund or CF EF).
11. Budget CF.
12. Ensure that the total amount in Uno matches total amount of CF EF.

Lea's subsidy: Php 10,000

The subsidy could be allocated to the following expenses in VF.

Food - 5,000
Rent - 3,500
Dining out - 1,000
Pets - 500

Total: 10,000

# Old Process

Below is an old process. I'm keeping it in case I return to it.

1. Open Google Drive > Areas > Vinceâ€™s Financial System
2. Go to the Finance Sheet.
3. Compute your monthly income from the following sources:
- Paid work (Scribendi)
- Bank interests (BPI, EastWest, CIMB, ING)
- Others
4. Complete logging your monthly income in Dollarbird.
5. Complete logging your expenses in Dollarbird by checking expenses from the following sources:
- BPI debit card
- BPI credit card
- CIMB debit card
- Paymaya debit card
- Lazada app wallet
- Shopee app wallet
- Gcash app wallet
5. Log breakdown of expenses.
6. Calculate Total Expenses.
7. Calculate Ending Balance.
8. Log the current balance of the following accounts:
- BPI
- EastWest
- ING
- CIMB Gsave
- CIMB FastPlus
- Tonik
- Moneygment
- Lazada Wallet
- Shopee Wallet
- Paymaya
- Credit Card
- Gcash
- eToro
   - Determine how much your eToro contribution is in Php from the past month by looking at your CIMB FastPlus history.
   - Add your eToro contribution with your total eToro contribution last month. You do track this beforehand, so you can just refer to [[private/List of money invested in eToro ]].
- COL Financial
- COL Financial dividends
- eToro dividends

Since you are doing this calculation on the first day of the month, do not forget to include in your Monthly Tabulation all expenses you incurred in this first day.

After performing this review, review your finances again when your monthly income arrives around the sixth day of the month, then budget ([[My budgeting experiment]]).

To do
- Update this since you are already using YNAB.
