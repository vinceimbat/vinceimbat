# Past Year Questions

## List your 3 top wins for the year.

1. I was able to cope well and even thrive while I was managing my tinnitus and waiting for habituation to happen.
2. I was able to build a minimum viable life management system, which finally freed me from the emotional stress that prevented me from moving my creative life.
3. I was able to embrace a healthier lifestyle and lose 30 kilos intentionally, while buying and cooking my own food.

## What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned in the past year?

1. I learned how important hearing is in one’s overall well-being.
2. I learned that in order to really survive every single day, we need to look for a reason to keep going.
3. I learned that we can employ the power of game to create personal and societal changes.
4. I learned that happiness is a habit that needs to be nurtured and cultured every day.
5. I learned that I need to leave Santa Maria to start my own life away from my family and my past life. It is the only way I can truly embrace my authentic self and start a life I can be really proud of.
6. I learned that I can actually live by myself, independently from Mama and Papa, without really feeling lonely, and that I can take care of my needs effectively by myself.
7. I learned how to effectively design an integrated total life-management system and how to use it to support a fulfilled life.
8. I learned that all setbacks are simply challenges that help me develop the skills to improve my emotional equilibrium.
9. I learned how to buy food, cook food, and eat food in a healthy way that is friendly to my stomach and my weight.
10. I learned that a life-management system is not enough to be happy and that I need to focus on well-being habits that ensure enduring happiness and emotional equilibrium consistently.
11. I learned that being myself is a community service.
12. I learned that affecting the quality of the day is the highest form of art.
13. I learned that I could focus on the most important interests in my life by employing my overarching principle or mission.
14. I learned that I can be more facilitative in my writing.
15. I learned how important it is to build a note-writing practice to develop my thinking and writing further.
16. I learned how to be courageous and unapologetic in my writing.
17. I learned how to accept critical feedback and use it to write better.

## What were the risks you took?

1. I reached out to Lea and tried to see if it was possible to get back together even if I wasn’t sure if she’ll accept me again and if things will work out well.
2. I faced my fears and attended Clyne’s wedding and after-wedding party where I saw family members and past JW friends that I have avoided for a very long time.
3. I showed up almost every day translating Thoreau into Filipino even if I don’t yet have a strong handle of the language.
4. I followed a diet approach to solve my LPR.
5. I invited Rem, Claire, Benjie, and Lea to join me for a weekly meet up.
6. I created a workshop on Thoreau (my first workshop in many years) and delivered it successfully.
7. I wrote an article where I admitted for the first time that I only work 5-10 days a month.

## What was your most loving service?

I felt true love when tending to my pets, especially when they were ill. I know it was too much love, especially for Oreo, because I experienced compassion fatigue.

## What is your unfinished business from the past year?

Creating a plan and system for my finances and material life.

## What are you most happy about completing?

I was most happy about completing the creation of a minimum viable life-management system.

## Who were the three people that had the greatest impact on your life in the past year?

1. Lea
2. Thoreau
3. Tiago Forte

## What was your biggest surprise?

Discovering Tiago Forte serendipitously, like all the other people who have shaped my thinking.

## What compliment would you liked to have received? Given?

Actually, I did receive a compliment I didn’t know I actually want to hear: That I am someone with a mix of humor and intelligence. I really like that. I want to embody that from now on.

Having said that, I would like to have received a compliment about the quality of my thinking. The reason why I haven’t received one is that I haven’t clearly articulated what I stand up for and I have not found my real tribe.

I would like to give Lea more compliments. I think I need to do that more often. I have told her, “I am proud of her,” and I did mention recently how grateful I am for having an intelligent, kind, and beautiful girlfriend, but I need to do it more often.

I have given compliments to Rem, Claire, Benjie, Maui, and perhaps others I can not remember. But this is definitely something I need to work more on. To be able to give good compliments, I need to be in touch with what the most important people in my life are doing.

## What else do you need to do or say to be complete with the past year?

I need to say thank you to my mother for everything she did for me when I was in Pangasinan. Now that I am all alone doing everything at home, I miss not just her generosity but also her mere presence.

## What one word or phrase best sums up and describes your experience this past year?

Emotional equilibrium

After everything that happened (tinnitus, the pandemic, tensions in the house, the death of the two pets, the LPR, the almost card fraud), I am amazed how much emotional equilibrium I have maintained.

## What stories from the past year are you letting go of?

1. I am letting go of the story that I need to stay at Sta. Maria to be happy, that I can’t live alone by myself, that I can’t find happiness within me, that I need my parents to cope with my problems. My transfer to Los Banos is a response and flows from letting go of this story.
2. I am letting go of the story that I need my family to be the way I want them to be. I am accepting where we are right now, and I won’t stress myself trying to piece our family together. I will continue to perform my duties as a son and brother, but will focus on my own life and my plans for building my own family in the future.
3. I am letting go of the story of playing it safe, of not challenging myself enough, because I am being called to show up and contribute to a community. I am letting go of the idea that I am a lesser human being after the depression. I am better, way better than that person I was in the past!
4. I am letting go of the story that I need to hide who I am to be part of communities and that I need these communities in the first place. I am braver to let go of communities that may have resonated to me at one point but no longer. Ginhawa and Zen are in mind. I will still connect with them once in a while. But my time is better spent building connections with communities that nurture my true self more, or better, in building my own communities.
5. I am letting go of the story that because I am introverted and I have OCD, I can’t build relationships by reaching out to potential networks. I want to take a risk, to challenge myself, and be braver by reaching out to people who could help me grow in my journey.
6. I am letting go of the story that social signals are not important. In fact, I need them for my mental health. To be able to articulate to other people who I am as a person and what I do also has its uses. It builds confidence on myself, my mission, and my vocation.
