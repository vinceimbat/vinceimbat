I am grateful for:

1. The tinnitus experience for teaching me a lot about healthy hearing, habituation, and healthy living.
2. Mama, Papa, Lea, family, and my friends for the support they provided me while going through the start of the tinnitus.
3. My visit to Antipolo with Lea for helping me see that there is a lot in life to enjoy despite tinnitus.
4. My second Ginhawa Well-being Retreat for helping me to reconnect with my body and introducing me to people who face a similar health challenge but are thriving in their own way.
5. The experience of becoming a PWD, of applying for the ID and using that ID for the first time. It has been very instructive both in the societal context of my experience as well as my pschological reactions to it.
6. The fact that my tinnitus did not prevent me from being functional and did not drastically affect my sleep.
7. Finding the courage to face my fears of seeing family members and past JW friends in Clyne’s wedding.
8. Turning 28 this year.
9. The many beautiful reasons for living that helped me cope with my tinnitus.
10. My taking responsibility of my healthcare.
11. My capability to work for money despite the tinnitus.
12. Tita Villa’s visit to the Philippines and all our travels with her, which were some of the only one’s we had the entire 2020 before the quarantines.
13. The lockdown that separated me and Lea for 300 days. It tested our relationship and made us better people in general.
14. The tension that resulted from being stuck inside the house with Bernice. The issue revealed that it is hopeless for me to want to change the family to adjust to who I am now. It also convinced me that I need to leave Pangasinan as soon as the quarantine relaxes.
15. The creative time and space that the quarantines provided to me personally and to many of my friends and family members.
16. Tungko, for providing me with a source of social connection in a time of extreme social isolation.
17. All the new friends I made through Tungko Unang Salang.
18. How Tungko reshaped my friendship with Rem.
19. Jane McGonigal’s book “Reality is Broken” for convincing me to come out as a gamer and appreciate the power games can have on individual and social well-being.
20. Laurie Santos, her work, and her course The Science of Well-being.
21. Being able to explore blind contour drawing.
22. Being able to launch Mantaltaliwa.
23. Finally exploring the fields at the back of our house in Pangasinan.
24. Lea’s transition into freelancing. Witnessing how her overall well-being has improved after leaving dentistry is amazing.
25. The cooking sessions I had with Mama. I felt closer to her and that helped me get ready with what is at store to me: living alone and eating healthier.
26. Being able to explore newspaper blackout poetry.
27. Cablong. Without the house and lot at Cablong, the quarantine would have been even full of stress as Bernice won’t have a place to move to.
28. Chikako and Doji for accompanying me most of the days I was alone at home. Even if they don’t talk, just seeing them wag their tails or respond to my endearments, really helped me cope with being alone at home.
29. The challenge to manage the house at Sta. Maria by myself.
30. Deciding to translate Thoreau into Filipino.
31. The successful purchase of my Macbook Pro and its setting up.
32. Being able to leave Facebook for more than one week.
33. Caroline Miller’s goal-setting workbook for helping me connect positive psychology and goal-setting.
34. Tiago Forte’s Annual Review process for providing me a well-designed review process that connects my days, weeks, months, and years. Through his process, I also realized that I wasn’t setting scary goals for myself.
35. I am grateful for Oreo for coming into my life even for a brief time. Among all the dogs we ever had, she has the best personality. Her illness taught me that I easily experience compassion fatigue so I need to protect myself from it. Her death also convinced me to explore stoicism. Our paths meeting at that brief time is nothing short of a miracle. I will be forever grateful for meeting her.
36. I am grateful for Gripo for coming into my life even for a brief time. Through her illness and passing, I saw how much my mother could love someone. I do not doubt my mother’s love for me because of this. We have slowly recovered from Gripo’s death and like Oreo’s, I embraced stoicism because of her passing.
37. Everything that Mama has done for me, the family, and even the pets for this entire year. I can’t imagine 2020 without her.
38. The LPR for telling me how much I have abused my stomach. It provided the needed but painful feedback that I was doing something wrong with my body. Through it, I stopped intermittent fasting, embraced small but frequent meals, tried a healthier diet, and ultimately lose 30 kilos, shifting my weight from obese to overweight.
39. The successful purchase of my new Macbook Pro. The transition taught me a lot about how to buy the right Macbook for myself, the ins and outs of good deals, and other useful knowledge that I could use in the future if I buy another machine.
40. My favorite bike trail, and the spots there where I meditated, wrote a poem, lie down to see the stars, cry, and talk to Dondon for hours. Now that the old trail is gone, a piece of me is gone. But I am really thankful that I got to enjoy that trail when it was still beautiful and unadulterated.
41. Lea’s surprise dinner date with Rem, Claire, Benjie, and JV. That meet provided a much-needed relief from all the stress and grief of July and August. What’s more, it provided the impetus for the creation of Fruit Salad.
42. Celebrating our first anniversary as a couple. I am grateful for the song that Lea dedicated to me on that day.
43. Being able to finish my minimum viable life system through understanding Tiago’s work.
44. The reminded that a life system is not enough to be happy and that I need to focus on well-being habits that ensure enduring happiness and emotional equilibrium.
45. Having the courage to invite Rem, Claire, Benjie, and Lea to meet fortnightly (which they turned into weekly) so that I maintain emotional health throughout the coming months.
46. I am grateful for getting to know Claire more.
47. I am grateful for getting to know Benjie more.
48. The film My Octopus Teacher, for reminding me that I needed to connect more with Nature, and thus prompting me to explore new bike trails.
49. Thoreau for showing me the beauty of Nature and showing the way on how to experience it deeper.
50. Elizabeth Gilbert’s FB post “Be Yourself. People will thank you.”
51. All the field works I took during the last quarter of 2020. Really investing time and resources to these field works improved my overall creative process.
52. The iNaturalist app for encouraging me to pursue botany.
53. Brian Mertins for his video and article lessons on exploring nature. They helped me see Nature in a better light as I did my field works.
54. Seeing Lobong CIS in a different way, a Walden Pond of my own. It provided an alternative place for me to commune with Nature after my favorite bike trail lost its allure. Going there also meant exercising vigorously, so visiting it really hit multiple birds with one stone.
55. Claire’s workshop on grief writing. This helped me write a fantasy story that processed Oreo’s death, which in turn inspired me to go back to Caboloan even for just a brief time.
56. The film Paterson, for showing me how easy it is to be a poet.
57. Realizing that writing my monthly highlights can actually help me in future reviews.
58. Being able to create a workshop on Thoreau’s life and creative process through book highlights and notes. I learned more about Thoreau by teaching his life. Plus I got to use Tiago’s progressive summarization and BASB teachniques in producing a tangible output.
59. Being able to sustain daily blogging and weekly newsletter writing ala Austin Kleon for at least two weeks. I just have to pivot after learning about note-writing. But the trial was a good educational experience.
60. Seeing how unschooling can be applied in an adult’s creative life.
61. Being reminded that I could focus on the most important interests in my life by employing my overarching principle or mission.
62. Rem’s workshop on facilitation, which encouraged me to look at other ways I can be more facilitative rather than prescriptive or instructive. For example, I realized that if I use more story-telling and poetry in my writing, I am more facilitative.
63. All the books I read, especially my hero books of 2020.
64. Sonke Ahrens excellent book “How to Take Smart Notes” for inspiring me to really invest time in a note-writing practice.
65. Andy Matuschak for showing me his process and the intelligent rationale behind these processes.
66. Migs for our brief bonding time.
67. My friends in Binmaley, who made the holiday season less lonely for me.
68. Bobet for sharing about the carpool, which change the next days of my life, including these first days of 2021.
69. The yearender with Tungko, where I was able to experience my first exchange tula: I wrote a poem for Abby and received a beautiful poem from Maui.
70. The new friends I made from Tungko Second Salang.
71. Finding the courage to write the piece on my multipotentiality, where I also admitted that I only work 5-10 days a month.
72. Being able to accept critical feedback and use it to improve my work.
73. Thoreau’s journal for providing me with a devotional for an entire year—a devotional that reconnected me with myself, with Nature, and with my fellow human being.
74. The successful management of Doji’s wound.
75. The relief that came from learning that the credit card fraud case I almost got did not push through. This event showed me that there is work to be done in terms of improving my digital security. But more importantly, it showed that I have actually developed more emotional maturity in dealing with cases like this.
