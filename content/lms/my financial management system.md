# A. Cushion

Total Cost: P140,000 (P20,000/month good for 6 months + P20,000 for drawdown)

- [x] Put P70,000 in a 6% per annum time deposit account in Tonik.
- [x] Put P30,000 in a GSave Account in CIMB digital bank.
- [x] Invest P40,000 to FMETF and AREITS via COL Financial

# B. Cache

Total Cost: P40,000

- [x] Put P40,000 cache account to a different high-interest bank account (ING).

# C. Daily Cash

- Moving forward, BPI will just hold the minimum maintaining balance of P3,000. It will also be used to receive incoming income.
- Moving forward, keep my monthly expenses to P20,000 or less per month (See: [[My monthly fixed expenses]]).
- Moving forward, maintain a P20,000 monthly investment savings. Treat this money as sacred. It shouldn't be touched.
- Any expense incurred that is not part of the usual monthly expenses or whenever I exceed the P20,000 expense limit, I don't compensate using my P20,000 monthly investment savings. Instead, I use my cache (BPI and CIMB).
- To replenish the cache to 50,000, I only have two options: (1) Lessen my monthly expenses or (2) Increase my monthly income (in Scribendi, this means taking on more projects than usual).

# D. Capital

- [x] Invest an initial amount of **P140,068.432 ($2,920)** on a [[Ginger Ale Portfolio]] via eToro.
- [x] Invest P40,000 to the Philippine market via COL Financial.
- [ ] Create a monthly investment contribution habit.
- [ ] Establish a business.
