# Summary

In January 2022, I read and took notes on the book A Philosophy of Walking by Robert Gros and the article The Moderate-Minded Writer by Matthew Nisbet. I also started studying Thich Nhat Hanh’s work. Since it is the beginning of the year, I also conducted my annual review, improving my process along the way. I also started learning web design and development as part of improving the Sharing category of action in my life work. Along the way, I realized that there is so much to learn, so I decided to create a temporary site where I could start publishing. Then, I practiced web development by building Kaliskis na Ulap via Hugo and bought a full-stack web development course in Udemy to start learning through it. It was a tough start of the year. I went through a short depressive episode right after new year. Friends, Lea’s family, and lots of games got me throught it all.

# Projects

## Annual review

- Performed my annual review using a new updated system.
- After finishing the review, Lea and I spent an afternoon in Cafelandia talking about our goals for the year and for January.
- Realized that my annual review format didn’t really make it easy for me to write an annual review article. I modified my system for this to happen.
- I dropped my weekly reports to simplify the process.

## Learn web design

- I learned Flux's free web design course and learned about the following:
   - Why separate design from development
   - How to edit photos
   - Content strategy and information architecture

## Learn web development

- Encountered jamstack development.
- Learned domain cloaking.

## Thoreau translations

- I created a canva FB post on a translation of Thoreau’s quote, which got some good traction.
- Translated [[Bigyan mo ako ng katotohanan]] and shared it on social media.

## iPhone

- I wanted to repair my 7 Plus, but I destroyed it instead. I learned several things though:
   - Perform a repair only when you have the right tools, good lighting, and are confident with your skills.
   - If it is this difficult to perform a repair on a machine, how about a repair on the human body via surgery.
   - I realized I am still hugely embedded in the Apple environment. Leaving it should be done slowly.
- I decided to buy a second-hand iPhone 11 Pro Max from a credible source and sell the iPhone 11 Pro once and for all.

## Covid 19 vaccine

- Reactivated the project and seriously reconsidered the issue with an open mind.

- I learned how to point a Google domain to Netlify.
- I installed the Netlify CMS in my site.
- Through this project, I had a first-hand experience on what developers go through: encountering a problem, redoing steps until the problem is found, and redoing again.
- I wrote copies for the homepage, the about page, and the contact page.
- I made a temporary logo for the site using Canva.
- I launched the site and shared it to my friends.
- Bevs participated in my open source translation idea,.

## Temporary vinceimbat.com

# Life Areas

## Life System

I didn’t do much in this area this month. I just let my projects and interests dictate what I want to do. I did improve my annual review process to make it easier for me to write an annual review blog post.

## Physical Health

My weight lingers between 195 to 200 lbs. I decided to take the jab but with ivermectin to protect myself from possible adverse reactions.

## Mental Health

I hade multiple dissociative experiences, including one very bad attack that convinced me to quit caffeine, esp. the strong ones.

## Relationships

I received support from Diwa during the tough start of the year. Through her, I was also able to meet Yvette. I even bonded with her and her dogs. To reciprocate, I helped Diwa by introducing her to PARA and invited Ju to a walk. I also received emotional reinforcement by spending time with Rem at Sto. Tomas. I was able to help him get insights through my presence, listening, and thoughts. But the most important thing that got me through a tough January was playing games with Lea’s family. We played Anomia, Ticket to Ride, Coup, Betrayal at House on the Hill, Werewolves, and ML. Lastly, through Michelle Panning, I learned that I have a tendency to be avoidant in my relationships.

## Sustenance

I achieved my income goals for this month. Early this month, I initiated a budgetting experiment. I wasn’t able to follow the budget because I bought a new iPhone.

## Life Work

This month, I started learning web design and development as part of improving the Sharing category of action in my life work. Along the way, I realized that there is so much to learn that I can’t wait for my studies to end before I could start sharing. So I decided to create a temporary site where I could start publishing. Then, I practiced web development by building Kaliskis na Ulap via Hugo. Then I bought a full-stack web development course in Udemy and started learning through it.
