# Using Writing Workshop Applications the Right Way

Learned that I didn't get in CCWW, which prompted questions about the trajectory of my writing life.
- Discuss your new perspective on applications.
- The healthiest attitude to approach these application processes should be not to use them to accumulate laurels but to use that as what they really are: as forces to compel you to do the work. Whether you get in or not (highly likely you won't), you were able to move your personal project. Everything is about your personal projects. Articulate what your art stands for and focus on creating a portfolio around that stand and never ever rely on other people to tell you you're good or publishable. Stick to your gut feel and use contests, workshops, and fellowships to serve your vision, not the other way around.

Sent a collection of 12 Pangasinan poems as entry to the Gawad Bienvenido Lumbera literary contest. Like I said above, I am using these application processes to force me to do work and teach myself writing. For the GBL, it was about learning poetry, particularly revising it. To prepare for the GBL, I chose the best Pangasinan anlong (poems) in my Talahardin. I started with the minimum number set by the contest guidelines (7) but later added five more when I discovered the theme of the collection by accident. I called the collection Kasabi Kaagwan or When Noon Comes, thus the number 12.

Then I created a [[thoughts/poem revision process|poem revision process]] based on [[literature/billy collins masterclass|Billy Collins' Masterclass]] and used it to improve each poem in the collection.

I am pretty sure I won't win any awards but I have 12 poems that have were way better than when I first wrote them (way way better!) and this for me is enough.

Worked on an essay on my writing system, which I sent for publication to a literary journal. If it gets accepted, you'll be the first to know. If not, I'll immediately share it here.

# Bohol

Bohol trip. Something to write more about. To be honest, it is difficult for me to write about Bohol. Among all the provinces I've visited in the Philippines, this was the most commercialized, and I felt so distrustful of people the whole time. I am still looking for the right angle and story to share to you about that trip. For now, let some photos tell the story.

In response to my reading of [[thoughts/a religion of ones own by moore|A Religion of One's Own by Thomas Moore]], I started a [[thoughts/dream log|dream log]].

A beautiful existential thought from James Clear: meditating that the thing we are doing or the time we're going to a place could be the last.
