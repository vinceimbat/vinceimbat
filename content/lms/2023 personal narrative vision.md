I started the walk uphill. This is my last walk for 2023. I will join Lea and some friends in welcoming the new year in a few hours. As I walk, I am astounded by the closing of another chapter of my life. I look back and remember the best things that happened this year.

Early this year, I focused on **building a resilient livelihood system with multiple income streams that provide me at least 40k per month through work that feels good. This system encouraged me to transition toward doing work that brings me joy.**

I can't believe that I was able to pull it off! `I spend most of my days engaged in activities that are most important to me: writing, philosophizing, contemplating, walking, photography, and poetry. I enjoy ample creative freedom because my finances are secure and intact.` Currently, `my primary source of income is a day job I love.` But, `I am slowly building a passion business that will eventually replace my day job.` Aside from this, `I am helping Lea manage and improve her biz, which provides additional income.`

This sense of security was also created not by small part with an experiment of **launching a Patreon page**. I took a leap of faith, and it worked! All I needed to do was ask for help, and I was able to build a decent amount of patronage.

Because of this security and abundance, I finally **launched a book project about walking at Los Baños. I did a seven-day walk which I documented through a newsletter series. The material I collected from that walk is what I am now turning into a book. I am on the project's finishing touches, and I look forward to launching it in the first quarter of next year.**

The book project mustered my confidence and motivation to seriously **improve my web design and development, photography, writing, and connecting skills.** **I am now quite adept in understanding design principles, and I have applied that understanding in designing a digital garden website** that houses all the shareable artifacts of my creativity according to how I want them to appear and be organized. **I have mastered using the Canon Mark II and have improved my capturing and editing skills.** `Daily practice, courses, and feedback have also improved my writing.` Through the book project, **I have learned how to approach people, ask for guidance, and interview or greet strangers in my walks.**

I can progress in all these areas because `I am supported by a well-maintained, efficient, and practical life management system. I am continuously using and improving this system that helps me perform intentional actions and informs my creative projects.` ==My forest garden of the mind, an essential component of this LMS, has accumulated at least 300 quality notes containing my most valuable ideas and personal knowledge. I have effectively articulated how my LMS works and have taught how to build one for others.== `Most importantly, this LMS has supported me in my quest for wisdom.`

I am still in awe about what focus and dedication can achieve. I have grown much as a creative doing this project, encouraging me to continue treading this path. This achievement was made possible not in small part because of the people who have helped me along the way.

Early this year, **I connected with mentors doing work I wanted to do. I interviewed them about their stories. Through their help, I gained clarity on my life design. They have also provided me with valuable resources and have connected me with other mentors and peers who helped me with my dreams and goals. I show my gratitude to these relationships by nurturing them and providing value to them while I take advantage of their help.** For example, **I have assisted Sir Melchor Orpilla in publishing his collection of poems**, and **I have also assisted Kuya Iktoy in publishing the translation of his book.** Some of these people have been close friends who I slowly welcome into my inner circle.

Even after my life design project, ==I continued to look for archetypes who showed me what is possible in this life. I regularly converse with self-directed and autonomous creatives, thinkers, and contemplatives deeply grounded in their aspirations to live a good life and share their stories beautifully. I have established a regular habit of searching and reaching out to these people regularly.

As I nurtured the new people in my life, I continued maintaining the most important relationships I already had. **I have proposed to Lea, and we are preparing for our wedding next year.** Living with her for an entire year has been very helpful in the flourishing of our relationship. Our bond has been solid. We support each other's growth as we pursue our most authentic selves.

I have also continued to nurture my closest friendships. We regularly meet and support each other. **I have transformed our simple abode into a welcoming home for these important people.** ==I periodically invite them for meaningful and transformational conversations and camaraderie.== **I have clearly articulated what kind of people I want to bring into my life and my inner circle. I have proactively sought after these people and nurtured my relationships with them.**

Moreover, **I have fulfilled my promise to take care of Rem's family and legacy.** `My pets are all alive and well. And I continue to spend regular time with my family in Pangasinan and Baguio. I continue to enjoy the peace around my neighborhood`, and ==my relationship with Lea's family, although still tricky, has shown improvement.==

I can achieve all these in no small part because I have cared for myself. `I have followed a daily routine that encourages good writing and thinking.` ==I sleep eight hours a day, keep my intermittent fasting routine, and have only one heavy meal a day (lunch). I only eat smoothies at night. I have reduced my sugar and carbs intake and increased my diet's veggies, fruits, and fermented foods. I also have regular days of exercise every week and can manage my stress well through mindfulness and contemplative practices like walking.== `I learned to avoid stressors as much as possible and live a relaxed and calm life.` ==I have improved my self-confidence by only wearing clothes that make me feel good about myself.== And most importantly, `I live in a home and environment that encourages contemplation and creativity. I could also start tapering my antidepressant to 1/4 a pill daily.`

As I reach the peak of this hill, I stop under the shade of a large tree. The sun has begun its descent, altering the colors of the sky as if a large, heavy orange ball pulls with it the entire cosmos. I felt a sense of gratitude buried in my bones. It is as if nothing has changed, but everything has also changed. Questions abound about what the coming year has in store for me—for all of us—and I basked in the warmth of uncertainty.
