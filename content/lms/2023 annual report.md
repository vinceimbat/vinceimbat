# January

I started this month doing my annual review and assisted Lea in performing her own annual review as part of setting up her minimum viable life management system. After finishing my annual review, I finished the trial run of updating the Bookbright OVIC overviews and accomplished the Proofreading Pal application process.

I engaged in very little philosophizing this month, but I caught several good insights, including an insight about why commitments should be celebrated and why altruism is important. Most of the writing I did this month was journaling and poetry. I had a very deep experience looking at the moon at Aglibut Ave during one of my walks that I wrote a poem draft about it. Using insights I learned from Billy Collins' poetry masterclass, I also edited some of my poems, which I later sent to TLDTD.

Benjie and I continued LBLP, and I shared my favorite photos of 2022, which received positive feedback. The best walk I did this month was my walk with Lea to Dampalit Falls. Someone from IG also reached out to me expressing their gratitude for the work I did in my website, which has been helpful for them in building their own life management system.

This month was filled with time spent reconnecting with my relationships. During this month, Lea and I helped Champy go through solving her dental problems. I also got into a three-hour call with Megs and Cams and joined Tuloy-Daloy in creating an urn for Rem made of mud. Lea and I also met Rio and Mac at San Pablo. Later this month, I went home to Pangasinan to attend Tito Lito's funeral and reconnect with Jay Vee and our friends. After this, I bonded with my cousins in Binmaley.

In between all of these activities, I spent time getting more clarity on what source of income to look for. I read Pivot to clarify my runway and strengths. Then, I tried applying at editing and academic writing platforms, trying out things and feeling if they are a fit. To add income, I also sold some unused books.

# February

The main areas I nurtured this month were sustaining and connecting. I did a new set of OVIC overviews and got paid for the trial run I did last month. I also landed a research ghostwriting gig, which Claire referred to me, and which I landed through an awesome cover letter, a decent enough discovery call, and an excellent writing test. Landing this job boosted my confidence. It was my first real win throughout this job search process, and with that it was already worth-it by itself. Doing the work also gave me a refresher on research writing, which will help me when I focus on editing academic writing. These two gigs gave me some sense of security and convinced me to use the free time I generated to focus on achieving consistency of income through freelance editing and writing. While looking for gigs, I also spent a considerable amount of time just brainstorming the ideal business setup I want. I read The Free Agent Ecosystem by Tiago Forte, which introduced me to some really important principles I plan to incorporate in my freelancing.

I spent time bonding with Camille and my cousins, realizing that in a few months, my relationships with my cousins will definitely change as they transition into marriage life. I also made my intention to establish a daily connecting practice through a personal CRM app called Clay. Clay encouraged me to reach out to people like Kleinifer Palma. This led to an unexpected reunion at Baguio with her and Gerald Bandonil. I also started chatting with Lovelle Almazar, a fellow editor in the Philippines. Also, I spent a simple birthday celebration with Lea, who gifted me with a hand and foot massage package. Speaking of massages, I had two body massages this month, something I wanted to do but never had since 2017 (?).

I enjoyed reading *Wilderness and the Heart*, specifically the article: "Answering the Call of the Wild: Walking with Bugbee and Thoreau" by Daniel W. Conway and "Things I Like About Christianity" by Steve Patterson. I also wrote three poems and had a few walks.

# March

I spent the first week of March strengthening the concept of my client's research proposal on inclusion of people with disabilities. After delivering the final version of the draft, instead of jumping right into editing and proofreading study, I faced my fears and decided to do something for my art in the remaining days of the month even if I still didn't have a consistent flow of income. I decided to write an entry for the Ateneo National Writers' Workshop 20, which I sent on the last day of the month. After some deliberation, I decided to focus on how walking helps me traverse the psycho-socio-religious liminality I am currently in.

In between these two major projects, I spent some time performing a metalearning project to look for the best resources and create a customized curriculum for improving my editing and proofreading skills. I also did two batches of overviews for Boobright. Lea and I also went to a few adventures. We celebrated her birthday through a picnic lunch at Freedom Park. Then we went to Enchanted Kingdom where I faced my fears and explored emotions I never knew I had.

Throughout the month but particularly by the end, there were several occasions of bonding with our community. Benjie and Joji came to visit Los Baños and expressed desire to transfer here in the future. In addition, Lea and I went to Bal Bibal's Impression Workshop. We also attended the opening of Maui's solo exhibit, where I read my translation of A House Called Tomorrow by Alberto Rios and experienced flow while playing indigenous musical instruments. We then explored Elbi's hip-hop scene by watching Bevs' gig. Finally, we bonded with Kris Ann a couple of times.

After extending my runway, I was also able to open potential website design and development projects with Ili Likhaan and Candent. I also started tapering my meds down to 1/4 tab per night and I was generally okay.

# April

This was perhaps one of those full months. I started it by attending the Writing to Free Your Heart workshop by Rofel Brion at Casa San Pablo. The workshop gave me an opportunity to build my relationships with Sir Rofel and Ms. An while enjoying Casa San Pablo. This was a month of workshops. Maui's Ilihan Workshops exposed me to new friends like Louise Far who gave me a much-needed affirmation to start the photo book about walking LB this year no matter what. Speaking of walking and writing, my essay on traversing liminality through walking got me a spot at the upcoming ANWW20. This news encouraged me to return to the craft of writing and learn in preparation for it.

Interestingly, I also designed, simulated, and held two Nasa Labas ang Ili guided walks this month as part of the Ilihan workshops. These walks connected me with beautiful new friends and provided further motivation to my desire to write a book about LB.

All of these events and interactions moved me to return to my core—my sky level. I improved my sky level by spending some time at the middle of this month clarifying my purpose, vision, mission, and life goals.

While enjoying all of these creative activities, I was able to learn how to create processes for offering web design and development services for clients. My proposal for Ili Likhaan Ceramics was accepted. I also began improving my personal website by putting newsletters into individual folders and redirecting links.

I also tried a few new cafes and restaurants for the first time this month: Viewpoint Cafe, Burgarage, Malaya Cafe, Gong Cha, and House of Aina.

I finished the book *May Nagsabi Sa Akin* by Rofel Brion and *The Deleted World* by Tomas Tranströmer. In series, I really enjoyed Beef. In movies, I was moved by The Fundamentals of Caring.

# May

This month, I started seriously considering that my field was letters. Although I still see my work as an exploration of how to think, feel, and live better, I do these in the context of using beautiful words. I think this was affected by my recent achievements in writing.

Despite being busy with client work, I would consider this month as a month of writing. I wrote five poems, mostly in their final forms. I read *The Elements of Style*, finally, and immediately felt its effect on how I write. I have also started reading *On Writing Well*, which is a powerful complement to it. But the biggest gift I received was the advice I got from Sir Rofel Brion, Froi, and Taks on how to approach the ANWW20. Their ideas were enough to make me feel relaxed and more confident in reading the works of my co-fellows.

Froi read my essay and liked it: he said I would go far in walking and writing. He advised me to tweak the essay and send it to Palanca just to try. This I did, which became a very instructive experience. More than the skills I learned while doing this project, I'm grateful for the realization that I have to confront my past life as a Jehovah's Witness more intentionally. I started doing this by journaling, walking, and watching the film Apostasy. This month, I was also able to send my first TLW email after 6 months.

Still in writing, I contended with some difficult feelings about my family not showing interest in what I do. I was reminded by Keri Smith's words: I shouldn't expect my family to cheer me on in my art, especially now that we have grown far apart.

This month, I was sustained by the money I received from Candent and Ili. I learned how to work with clients and deliver what I promised. I also migrated Pathfinder's Commune to a free hosting provider and realized I want to commune with Rem through this blog soon.

Although not as vibrant as last month, I still spent good times with friends and family. I particularly enjoyed cooking with friends in front of Freedom Park, spending time at Candent with Benjie and Joji, buying clothes with Lea at SM Calamba, and bonding with Dan and Kris Ann.

# June

I returned to photography this month when I spent two days learning how to use the Canon EOS M50 Mark II through YouTube videos and more importantly the book [[literature/read this if you want to take great photos by carroll|Read This If You Want to Take Great Photos by Henry Carroll]] for Bukas na Hapag. In that event, I experienced eating Tempeh Itum, Binatog Elote, Dinnanaw at Gininub, and Kulawong Talong while learning about the intricacies of the Filipino food system.

The biggest highlight of the month was, of course, my preparation and attendance to the [[thoughts/anww20|ANWW20]]. Through this, I experienced preparing a presentation and delivering it to a group. I also experienced receiving close, practical feedback on my work. I also made new friends from my co-fellows and panelists. I particularly enjoyed my chats with [[thoughts/elio garcia|Elio Garcia]], [[thoughts/vincenz serrano|Vincenz Serrano]], [[thoughts/jhoanna lynn cruz|Jhoanna Lynn Cruz]], [[thoughts/junley lazaga|Junley Lazaga]], and [[thoughts/eli guieb|Eli Guieb]]. At the graduation ceremony, I also got the chance to read [[translations/isang tahanang tatawagin nating bukas|Isang Tahanang Tatawagin Nating Bukas]].

This month, like most months, was an opportunity to enrich relationships. Before leaving for Ateneo, Lea and I bonded with Bevs and Embi, who shared that he also came from a pastor's family. Before checking in at Ateneo, I met with [[thoughts/louise far|Louise Far]] with whom I exchanged life stories and insights. She also gave me a copy of her book [[literature/inahan sa sugilanon by louise far|Inahan sa Sugilanon]]. After checking in at Ateneo and having dinner with my co-fellows, I walked with Maui, Yano, and Ron around UP Oval then went to the University Hotel.

After ANWW20, I went back to Pangasinan to attend Bernice's wedding. I travelled with Lea and I introduced her to my extended family. After Lea left, I went back to Cablong and met Kitkat for the first time. Later, I met Ate Li and family for the first time in 10 years (?) then we had dinner at Naro Cafe.

While doing all of these, I continued working on Ili's website and Candent's marketing strategy, while reading *On Writing Well*, *The Collapse of What Separates Us*, and *Wanderlust* in between.

Lastly, I did several first-time walks this month: the walk from IRH to Katipunan, the walk along Maramba Blvd., and the walk at Matic-Matic–Maronong Road. I also experimented with using geolocation in my walking notes.

# July

A walk on the afternoon of [[daily notes/2023-07-12|July 12]] made me realize that [[thoughts/my morning writing practice|my morning writing practice]] was too important to exchange for some time to make money in the morning. This realization led me to review my writing life in general, including my systems and routines and evaluate them against my creative goals. I wanted to check whether my current writing practice is leading me toward my goals. The result was a better articulation of [[thoughts/my poetics|my poetics]]. While going through this process I remembered that what I truly wanted to write is [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy|lyrical philosophy]]—words that combine the beauty of the poem and the depth of philosophical inquiry. Thus, I articulated [[thoughts/how to practice and write lyrical philosophy|how to practice and write lyrical philosophy]].

So, this July, I got some more writing done. While making significant progress in the current website design and development projects I'm doing for two clients, both of which are ready to launch, I was also able to produce some work.

Some of my favorite writings this month include the walk poem drafts:
- [[poems/walk poem 1|Walk Poem 1]]
- [[poems/walk poem 2|Walk Poem 2]]

I wrote these poems initially as fragments of observations during two afternoon walks. My rule was to write a brief note on whatever piqued my interest or whatever thought calls on the walk and to separate lines per street where they occurred. Thus the number of stanzas equal the number of streets walked.

One Sunday morning, another poem came to me: [[poems/those stairs at bakakeng|Those Stairs at Bakakeng]].

Aside from these, I enjoyed writing these notes:
- [[thoughts/suicide|suicide]]
- [[thoughts/some experiences resist articulation|some experiences resist articulation]]
- [[thoughts/public life is necessary|public life is necessary]]

Lastly, I added my essay [[essays/a never-ending walk|A Never-ending Walk]] in [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|my forest garden of the mind]] and shared it in the [[newsletter]].

The best books I read this month were:
- [[thoughts/isang taong maghapon by paolo tiausas|Isang Taong Maghapon by Paolo Tiausas]]
- [[literature/inahan sa sugilanon by louise far|Inahan sa Sugilanon by Louise Far]]

I also re-read [[literature/the collapse of what separates us by vincenz serrano|The Collapse of What Separates Us by Vincenz Serrano]] to study the poems closely. I'll be sharing my notes on the site soon.

An essay I really loved reading this month was [[thoughts/melt the snowflake at once by david rothenberg|Melt the Snowflake at Once! by David Rothenberg]].

# August

In August, in between wrapping up a web design project with a client and starting a research writing project for a returning client, I managed to do some writing and studying. I returned to my study of [[thoughts/existentialism|existentialism]] by reading [[thoughts/jack gilbert|Jack Gilbert's]] poetry book *[[literature/refusing heaven by jack gilbert|Refusing Heaven]]*.

I enjoyed writing two notes this month:
- [[thoughts/public life is necessary|Public life is necessary]]
- [[thoughts/mindfulness over analysis|Mindfulness over analysis]]

I managed to publish three newsletter issues:

- [[vignettes/the very first memory|The Very First Memory]]
- [[vignettes/lolo aldo|Lolo Aldo]]
- [[poems/in july|In July]]

This August, I decided to apply to a regional writer's workshop that accepted works in my native [[tags/pangasinan|Pangasinan]] language. At first, I thought I should send some Pangasinan poems (*anlong*), so I finished [[literature/billy collins masterclass|Billy Collins' Masterclass]], which I thought should help me revise the poems better. But after finishing the course, I realized I wanted to focus on writing [[thoughts/lyric essay|lyric essays]]. This is a genre of writing that I have been doing for the past two years long before I've ever discovered the term, and although I love reading and writing poetry, I wanted to stay closer to something that was true to me and get better at it. Plus, the book about walking in Los Baños, which I am currently working on will be a book of lyric essays. Might as well practice now.

What resulted was [[essays/mulimuli pangasiniani|Mulimuli Pangasiniani]], which I translated into English as [[translations/perturbations on pangasiniani|Perturbations on Pangasiniani]]. It is a lyric essay about my personal struggles in writing in my mother tongue. While working on this essay, I read the works of other lyric essayists. A book that was particularly helpful was the anthology *[[literature/a harp in the stars by noble|A Harp in the Stars]]* edited by R. B. Noble.

I also started a collaborative writing project with a co-fellow at the Ateneo National Writer's Workshop: [[thoughts/jesa suganob|Jesa Suganob]]. Our project involves doing a series of walks from August to the end of September. We're free to choose on which days to do the walking as long as we use each walk as a prompt for writing an epistolary essay on that walk. The essay is directed towards each other, but we won't send the essays until the end of the project.

Meanwhile, my friend Patricia Domingo ([@promdikusinera](https://www.instagram.com/promdikusinera/)) recently launched a newsletter about her adventures as a Filipina chef. She called it [Salu-salo](https://salusalo.substack.com/), which means gathering, celebration, or feast. Cha is an earnest and uplifting writer and I really enjoyed her first issue (["Pause and Play"](https://salusalo.substack.com/p/pause-and-play)) where she talks about adobo, rest, and self-directed learning. She also described the [[thoughts/nasa labas ang ili|Nasa Labas ang Ili]] meditative walks I facilitated at UPLB last April.

Lastly, I was also able to update this website, which currently runs on a free open-source markdown publishing technology called [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), to the latest version (v4). I experience some major hiccups along the ways: one involved my website being down for more than an hour and me having to rebuild it from scratch. Major lessons: Update only when necessary. Don't try to fix what isn't broken. Introduce changes slowly. These lessons are also transferrable to almost everything in life.

# September

After reflecting on an excerpt from the essay "Presence, Memory, and Faith" by Steven E. Webb from *Wilderness and the Heart*, a book about [[thoughts/henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee's]] philosophy, while walking one night at Ela Ave., I realized that I could find contentment in every moment regardless of the situation and despite things being not okay. I could do this through faith, a word I've avoided ever since [[essays/a never-ending walk|leaving my childhood religion]], but now I'm exploring and reintegrating into my life through my interpretation. Indeed, [[thoughts/faith generates contentment|faith generates contentment]].

In response to my reading of [[thoughts/a religion of ones own by moore|A Religion of One's Own by Thomas Moore]], I started a [[thoughts/dream log|dream log]]. I noticed that starting a dream log seems to make me have more dreams and remember them.

My favorite thought note this month is: [[thoughts/art is never finished|Art is never finished]]. I wrote this while working on an essay I later sent to a literary journal. It talks about this modern bias to complete a work of art and why this could be going against the very nature of art.

The best things I read this month were:
- [[literature/lynda barry kios|Lynda Barry Will Make You Believe in Yourself by Dan Kios]]
- [[literature/nightingalingale by mod|The Nightingalingale Newsletter by Craig Mod]]

I published three newsletters this month:

- [[poems/this morning|This Morning]]
- [[vignettes/the possibility of love|The Possibility of Love]]
- [[vignettes/sabel|Sabel]]

My application to the Cordillera Creative Writing Workshop (CCWW) was rejected and this got me thinking about how I'm approaching these applications and my writing life. I realized that, since the acceptance rate to these writing events is pretty low, the healthiest attitude when applying is to expect rejection. Then, use the application process to these events to force you to do your work. Everything should be about your personal projects. Articulate what your art stands for, focus on creating a portfolio around that stand, and never rely on others to tell you you're good or publishable. Stick to your gut feeling and use contests, workshops, and fellowships to serve your vision, not the other way around. I used this newfound perspective in approaching the submission process to the Gawad Bienvenido Lumbera (GBL).

September was jam-packed with writing projects. Aside from the GBL and writing revisions for a client, I also worked on an essay that forced me to articulate my entire writing system and practice for the first time. It was a fun essay that braids walking and my note-writing system and their implications for literature in general.

Around the middle of the month, Lea and I visited Bohol to celebrate our anniversary. The trip helped me get back to photography.

# October

Jesa and I have finished revising all our essays and sent them to each other. We've exchanged our initial impressions about each other's work and considered our options moving forward.

I published two issues of The Long Walk last October 2023.
- [[poems/a midsummer rain in lb|A Midsummer Rain in LB]] (poem)
- [[thoughts/approach life with humor|Approach life with humor]] (note)

Inspired by the solar punk artists behind [Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co/site/home.html) I started to explore  free and open-source software like [Darktable](https://www.darktable.org/). I used it to edit photos from my recent trip to Bohol, which I shared on Instagram and [[essays/uman 2023-09|last month's issue of Uman]].

I went back home to Pangasinan, and I also visited my sister and her kids in Baguio. On October 15, a Sunday, I spent the morning walking from Engineer's Hill to Magsaysay Ave. in search of a Middle-Eastern restaurant. Alas I came too early; the beef won't be ready until lunch time. To kill time, I walked to and from the Bell Church. This walk led me down memory lane. This walk and my entire stay at Baguio made me realize that more than ten years after I left the church without saying goodbye to any of the friends and family I made there, I still grieve this loss.

After leaving Baguio, I finally accepted that I could no longer go through this long postponed grieving process alone. I knew I needed help, so I reached out to [[thoughts/andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown]] via email, which he generously returned with advice on how to begin embracing a free and creative religious existence.

With a few friends, I also visited Tita Cora and Rem's family at their house at Batangas to remember Rem's first death anniversary. The day was spent chatting, sharing food, playing video games, and communing with Rem's library.

# November

When I asked Andrew how one begins walking in this creative, free spirituality, he suggested trying seiza. Practicing seiza for a month has taught me a lot about being mindful of my posture. More importantly, seiza introduced me to two new people I now see as partners in this creative, free spirituality I'm exploring. In November, I attended three seiza group meditation sessions via Zoom, led by Miki Nakura. In one of those sessions, I sat silently with Andrew James Brown.

Per Andrew's advice I also started studying the life of [[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka (1881–1988)]] by reading the book [[literature/cosmic sage williams|Cosmic Sage]]. I also started reflecting on [[imaoka creed of life|Imaoka's Creed of Life]]. I synthesized what I learned so far in my essay [[essays/a goodness lurking|"A Goodness Lurking: The Quest for a Free, Subsistent Spirituality]]."

Thinking about Imaoka put me back to my quest and framing my life into a ministry. I asked myself what kind of ministry would fit my current life and realized that what preoccupied most of my 20s after leaving the church was an exploration of writing. I was primarily self-taught, and most of my writing was highly personal. And yet, it was a writing life nonetheless.

So, I began considering how I could transform writing into a ministry. I considered the methods of the [[thoughts/transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] through the book [[literature/literary transcendentalism buell|Literary Transcendentalism]] by Lawrence Buell and learned that they were primarily preoccupied with how writing can both be a tool to go deeper into transcendentalism (i.e., to live a unique ethical life) and a vehicle to express the creative genius they believe reside within every human being.

I then encountered [[Pat Schneider]] whose writing method detailed in her book  [[literature/writing alone and with others schneider|Writing Alone and with Others]] was used to transform writing into a method for spiritual and social change.

# December

This month, Lea and I joined Uwa, Abbey, and their dogs in the Makiling Challenge pet marathon. That morning was hands down one of the best mornings of my life. From the moment we arrived around six until we left about eight in the morning, the smile on my face never faded.

From December 4 to 10, 2023, I finally did a week-long walk around Los Baños, which I called Roots x Gravel. I walked for six days, taking a day off on December 6. Ultimately, I took 114,814 steps to cover 72.59 kilometers, including 87 streets in 13 barangays. The walk was a step forward on my project to write a book about Los Baños. It also helped me improve my writing, photography, and walking.

Roots x Gravel improved my patience when sharing the road with other pedestrians and motorists, something I've always found difficult, inspiring me to articulate [[thoughts/some rules on sharing the road with others|some rules on sharing the road with others]].

About two weeks after the project ended, I published an essay about my first solo walk of Bagong Silang last November 2023. That essay was entitled "[[essays/and i shall hear their hearts beating|And I Shall Hear Their Hearts Beating]]."

Roots x Gravel helped me return photography, practice the craft, and rethink my systems. With my photo library growing because of these walks, a photo backup system should be in place. I invested in a 2TB Sandisk external SSD to serve as the primary storage of my photo archive. I then backed this archive up in the cloud through my Backblaze account.

Next, I invested several hours going through my existing photographs, culling the albums, adding metadata, adding keywords, adding GPS coordinates, and renaming the best ones. While doing these, I had to return to photographs I took last year during [[essays/a never-ending walk|my long walk from Los Baños to San Pablo]]. Returning to these photographs, I noticed, was almost like re-walking that route.

I also spent a significant chunk of my December in dialogue with Jesa regarding our project. In our dialogue, I had to confront my ignorance of the gender lens, respond to her emails with grace, and write about what I know as well as what I'm still working on regarding my knowledge of walking as a writing method.

I also spent the last week before Christmas reading and studying [[literature/things become other things mod|TBOT by Craig Mod]].

Lastly, I traveled with friends to visit Maui and Yano at San Pascual, to walk around the town, and come in dialogue about our lives. There I also handed my photograph print gifts. Then, Lea and I spent New Year's Eve with Embi and Bevs and new friends Carl and his wife MC.
