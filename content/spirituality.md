In relation to [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]], I define it as an attitude of caring. It is a reverence we feel toward anything, which usually begins in faith, and which inspires us to attend to it with love and quality of action.

It is a concept one can use to differentiate a quality of "mechanical-ness" or cut-throat competition.

I need a word that captures as much of existence as possible. A word that is free that it could include an engagement not just with the good but also the bad. A word that could mean I am all of these that all these parts are interconnected that there is a thread that goes through these areas.

It's like philosophy but a way of life.

My niche is walking as a spiritual practice. But I need a clear understanding of what the word spiritual means before I could continue with my project
