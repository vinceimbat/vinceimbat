I am not sure if we really stop rationalizing. I think only the intensity of our rationalizing changes, but we only truly stop rationalizing when we are unconscious. This is because when we see insights and images—even if they arrive by themselves—the main fact that we recognize them, their form, and how they are different from others, we are automatically using reason and logic or whatever that is that allows us to discern what we see. We need a name for this capability. This is a capability to make a rational thought, which is made possible because of [[The three laws of logic]] (cf. [[Logic is inseparable from existence]]).
