Everything begins with [[purpose]] (See [[my purpose statement]]). To imagine what fulfilling my purpose looks like, I wrote [[my vision statement]]. To imagine how my vision could translate into action and allow myself to track my progress, I have created [[my life areas]] and wrote [[my mission statement]]. Within my life areas are goals that I track in [[my life goals master list]]. To ensure that I am performing actions that lead me toward my goals, I set up [[routines]].
