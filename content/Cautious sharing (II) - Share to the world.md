When you have built your confidence in the first part of the [[Cautious sharing process]] ([[Cautious sharing (I) - Set up a strong foundation]]), consider sharing to a wider and less familiar context:

1. Share to a scenius. Through [[Connecting]], you should be able to connect with an inner circle of peers from a [[Community of practice]] where you could run your ideas to.
2. Share to your audience. Once you have gained enough feedback and confidence, you are now ready to share well-developed ideas to a bigger audience. These could either be in a form of an article, a podcast, a video, etc.
3. Share to the world. If you are ready, you can also share to people who are not part of your audience but could potentiall be part of it.

There are nuances of this process when applied to different contexts. Sometimes, it is easier to directly share to the world than to start with loved ones. But loved ones should be people you trust.
