A good workflow should be structured in a way that optimizes autonomy ([[Freedom motivates us]], [[Autonomy lengthens your life]]). It should allow us to choose what we want to work on at any given time and transition smoothly from one task to another without compromising the bigger picture. A good workflow takes into consideration that everything is interconnected but are also mutually separate from one another. We need a system that is as comprehensive as GTD but suitable for an open-ended process. Such a workflow is made up of small tasks as [[Working on smaller tasks creates a sense of control]] ([[Break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]]). [[thoughts/my workflow]] should be optimized for freedom.
