It is possible to live life without examining it or being reverent on anything. And for some people, the good life is as simple as working, sleeping, then eating. This is for them, the good life.

So I agree, that this kind of thinking about how to live is specific to one kind of person. It is primarily for the curious, whose curiosity later leads to reverence.

This book is for the person who doesn't just want to live life but wants to understand it - how it is lived and how it is even possible to live it.
