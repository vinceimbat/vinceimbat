It is impossible to predict beforehand what particular action will produce what particular result in oneâ€™s creative process, especially if the desired result involves a lot of factors or is too far in time to know for sure.

Examples of these complicated problems are:

- Will I enjoy fame or recognition?
- Will I do better work in one or multiple languages?
- Should I use one or multiple websites?
- Should I serve a local or an international audience?
