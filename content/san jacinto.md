This is my hometown, a municipality adjacent to [[Manaoag]] and [[Mangaldan]]. Many of my poems are, of course, set here. I lived here most of my life, specifically from 1992 to 2008, when I left to study in [[baguio|Baguio]]. I returned in 2011 to recover from [[depression]] then left again to finish my studies from 2012 to 2014. I stayed in San Jacinto from 2014 to 2020, with at least three attempts to live in [[manila|Manila]]. I left in 2021 when I transferred to [[los banos|Los Ba√±os]]. Since the house in Sta. Maria is unlivable as of the moment, I think I won't be living there again for a very long time.
