The ancient religion of Japan. It is described by anthropologists as [[animism|animistic]]. I was surprised to know from [[andrew j brown|Andrew Brown]] that there are liberal forms of shinto. Notably, [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] discovered the relevance of shinto in his [[jiyu shukyo]]. I'm inspired to look into the Philippines' very own pre-colonial religion, [[anitism]], and see whether it is possible to integrate it into [[my jiyu shukyo]].
