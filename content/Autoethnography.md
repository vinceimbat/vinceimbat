Evocative autoethnography
- centers the lived experience of the researcher

Evocative autoethnography seeks “to make people feel deep in their guts and in their bones, using various forms of literary artfulness and storytelling to place the reader in the action” (Bochner & Ellis 2016, p. 63).

Autoethnography and narrative research methods are fluid, iterative, and relational, and “[i]t seems that there are no formal regulations regarding the writing of an autoethnographic account since it is the meaning that is important, not the production of a highly academic text” (Méndez, 2013, p. 281).
