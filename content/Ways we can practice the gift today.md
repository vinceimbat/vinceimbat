1. Give to beggar. Look at them as an opportunity to keep the gift open in society. But avoid those who have a clear modus and who sells overpriced commodities. Give what you can.
2. Avoid using wishlists when giving gifts. A wishlist makes gifting transactional by giving power to the receiver to dictate what they get.
3. Help the most needy parts of the community.
