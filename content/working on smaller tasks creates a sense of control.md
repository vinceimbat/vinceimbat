When we [[break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]], it becomes easy (e.g. [[writing can be easy]]). This is because we can change course if necessary or just because we want to. We are not forced to do anything we don't want to do. This creates a sense of control, which, in turn, stirs us towards pursuing what we really are passionate about. If our work provides us with this sense of control, it becomes a source of motivation, because [[freedom motivates us]], which makes our work sustainable. Also, [[autonomy lengthens your life]].
