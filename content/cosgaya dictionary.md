This is perhaps the oldest and most comprehensive dictionary of the [[Pangasinan]] language. However, most of the words contained in this volume are no longer used, making the bulk of this tome a historical reference.

I used this reference while developing a personal essay about different ways to walk as described by the Pangasinan language.

[[Melchor Orpilla]] said he has started translating this dictionary. However, he is prioritizing Pangasinan grammar since working on a dictionary is too much work.
