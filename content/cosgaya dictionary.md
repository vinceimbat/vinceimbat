This is perhaps the oldest and most comprehensive dictionary of the [[Pangasinan]] language. Compared to the [[Benton Dictionary]], it has more words. However, most of the words contained in this volume are no longer used, making the bulk of this tome a historical reference.

The dictionary is written in Spanish, so the spelling of the words use Spanish letters (for example, "c" instead of "k"). [[Melchor Orpilla]] said he has started translating this dictionary. However, he is prioritizing Pangasinan grammar since working on a dictionary is too much work.

I used this reference while developing a personal essay about different ways to walk as described by the Pangasinan language.
