My photos shall be philosophical. Capture an abstract concept from macrocosm then use a moment, a subject, an object to represent that.

Same with writing. Macrocosmic concept but use a vignette to represent it. My writing work should combine cosmic, local, and personal perspectives in one, moving from one to the other in a dance.

This is a style I borrowed from Thoreau.
