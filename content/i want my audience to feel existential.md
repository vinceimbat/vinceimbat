The ultimate experience I want my audience to feel is a feeling of happiness and meaningfulness grounded in [[truth]].

Now, that last part is a little tricky. To achieve that, I need to help my audience feel another emotion first: feeling existential.

I want my audience to feel existential. I want them to feel and remember the most important things in life. I want them to feel that this remembering is so important that it can save their life one day.

I want my creative work to help people appreciate their life and the universe continuously.
- I want my creative products to make people feel that their life and experiences are elevated, deep, and valuable.
- Whatever I learn from understanding and living my philosophy, I share it to the world primarily through artifacts that could serve as archetypes and models for anyone who is called to live a life of philosophical contemplation or those who just want to enhance their well-being and their life's meaningfulness.

By feeling existential, I hope they eventually feel philosophical. This will hopefully motivate them to learn about themselves more or the world around them.

To do this, I need to create beautiful works of art (text, audio, video, photo) that achieves the following:

- Share a specific insight.
- Share my story or point of view.
- Create a visual and audio experience that bring this insight to life.
- I want people to feel a certain restfulness.
