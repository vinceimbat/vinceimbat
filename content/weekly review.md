A weekly review is one of the four kinds of [[review|review]] necessary to maintain a functional [[life management system|life management system]]. [[thoughts/david allen|David Allen]] calls the weekly review the "Master Key to GTD” ([[getting things done|getting things done]])—the most critical habit to maintain the system.

According to [[tiago forte|Tiago Forte]], [[thoughts/a weekly review is an operating system|a weekly review is an operating system]], which is checked by a [[monthly review|monthly review]]. He further notes that, because [[thoughts/weekly habits are more difficult to build|weekly habits are more difficult to build]], establishing and maintaining a weekly review habit can be difficult. Nevertheless, when properly designed, a weekly review can free up your mind and spur you to take action ([[a life management system should free your mind]]; [[build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]]). For Tiago, a good Weekly Review should be done fast and lightly for about 15-30 minutes. To do so, the reviewer needs to resist the urge to actually do a task and focus on processing open loops.
