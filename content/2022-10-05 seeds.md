At first, you may not need purpose
- Connect here Tiago Forte's don't enforce a purpose.
- Connect here Steve Jobs' quote (stolen by AK) about connecting by looking backwards.
- Connect divergence-convergence and why we diverge first then converge at the last minute when we know everything already.
- Related too: skepticism, not hasty to committing.

Dont struggle and worry about the form. Worry more about the "ethics." The how to live.
