I think the attitude has to be: if I can help it, I will not let my past dictate what I know I could influence through my volition at this very moment.

I am not as brave as my friends. I am not as faithful. I need to feel secure in this financial place before I could return to the heights. I don't know if this is an unconscious inclination or I just need to do more thinking.
