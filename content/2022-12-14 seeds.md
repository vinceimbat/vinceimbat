As I returned to Los Ba√±os, I was haunted by homesickness (a confusing feeling because I already consider Elbi my home). Although I was happy to be working in my office again and grateful for being away from the triggers of old childhood trauma, I missed the quality of walks I enjoyed in Pangasinan. I had long walks there filled with solitude and nature on a level Elbi couldn't reach, especially now that students seem to fill every tiny crevice around town.

To put salve on my Pangasinan hangover, I started reading the frontmatter of the book Sarswelang Pangasinan.

In the evening I walked at UP (at Viado). Along the way, I stopped for a while to listen to a band play _Upuan_ by Gloc 9. The vocals of the rapper were really good. Meanwhile, a night market is currently in front of Baker's Hall. When I got to Carabao Park, people were watching Game 2 of the Battle of Katipunan.
