Anitism is the pre-colonial Filipino spirituality. It is similar to [[animism]].

It could be a resource for [[my jiyu shukyo]] particularly because of its similarities with [[pantheism]]. [[shintoism|Shintoism]] is also animist but has pantheist elements. If there is liberal Shinto then there could be, at least with my personal jiyū shūkyō project, a liberal anitism.

In such a progressive remaking of our precolonial spirituality, what I want to emphasize is the pantheistic elements—that nature is divine and that humans are part of that larger nature.

I should anticipate regional differences (e.g., Pangasinan anitism vs other regions) but also how these are interconnected with the deeper history of the Austronesian people. It is a project similar to [[shinichiro imaoka|Imaoka's]] immersion into Shinto.

A good resource for anitism is Isabelo de los Reyes' book Anitismo.
