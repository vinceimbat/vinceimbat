What am I sure of?
- writing: develop an intimate relationship and mastery to this craft
- walking:
- photography:
- religion, spirituality, and philosophy: establish a daily contemplative practice that helps me make sense of the world

Unsure
Writing
- Will conducting writing workshops be something I want to do? (Ask Maui for advice on conducting my first workshop.)
- Should I get an additional degree?
- Should I teach at the university?

Walking

Photography

Religion, spirituality, and philosophy
- Should I consider being a traditional minister?
- Should I consider becoming a counselor?

Supports
- Should I buy a farm and live there for simplicity?
