- [[poems/evening at pili drive]]

I sit here along Pili Drive
On an unmovable rock
Hard as the bones on my pelvis (?)
Sandwhiching the thin
Fat and skin that covers
My butt bones

Behind me
A constant stream of vehicles
Motorcycles
Cars
Vans
You name it
All bound home to
Hundreds of families

In front of me
The smell of wet grass
And mud
Conquers my lungs
My nostrils
Begging for more
An aftertaste
Of shells, and tadpoles,
And cricket eggs

Speaking of which
Oh,
The crickets.
Tiny sirens
Under a see of grass
Alluring
Consuming
What is left of the soundscape

A war
Between the sounds of
Nature
And machines
For which
My ears and temporal lobe
Are the battleground

I have no doubt
You know
Who wins

It is not that you are surrendering fast to LB unlike Pangasinan. No. You are surrendering to this idea this habit that you have to stay some place for as long as you can even if it is no longer working for you.
