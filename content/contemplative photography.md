I first heard about this term from [[Louise Far]] and is how I describe my practice of [[photography]]. Although, to be honest, I think this is a lazy description. I know very little about what the term means other than it uses a lot of [[mindfulness]]. My [[Tall Tales 1]] project in [[Baguio]] was the first project I did that used contemplative photography.
