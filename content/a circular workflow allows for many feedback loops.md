A circular workflow repeated often allows you to improve while working. Improvement involves correcting mistakes and getting more learning opportunities. And if in such a workflow you [[break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]], the feedback loops are smaller and therefore mistakes are easier to accept.

When you [[use a note-writing system]] like [[talahardin]], you get this circular workflow ([[talahardin is a circular workflow]]).
