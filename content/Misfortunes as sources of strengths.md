Misfortunes, undesired circumstances, and mid-life crises can become the seeds of great strengths. People avoid these things so aggressively that the states of mind they impart are rare, and valuable.

I find this really interesting. I went through depression. I experienced a mental state that most people didn’t have. Because of this, I am able to see the world differently. And it can’t be recreated. It is so rare and therefore so valuable.
