I try to articulate my purpose. Right now, my **purpose** is to achieve self-actualization and eventually transcend. To do this, I am dedicated to **understanding the truth about reality** (people and nature). I do this by cultivating a rich intellectual life, which involves daily studying (journaling, reading, Talahardin, philosophical walks). Through this intellectual life, I allow myself to change course and explore whenever I want to (**curiosity**) or dive deep into a specific subject (**love of learning**). The ultimate goal of such an intellectual life is to build wisdom and **perspective** on things. I share this perspective through the blog and through conversations whenever they are available.

Alongside this intellectual work is a different but related practice, which could also facilitate and enrich my intellectual tasks: I cultivate **appreciation of beauty and excellence** and their **continued freshness**â€”the small things as well as the big ones. This practice is mainly facilitated by walking and what I do when walking (savoring the environment, photography, and taking notes). This intentional exposure to beauty and excellence generates gratitude.
