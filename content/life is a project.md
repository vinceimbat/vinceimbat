Life involves goals. For some, it involves one big [[goal]]. Life involves actions that can be taken to achieve goals. The actions that fulfill one's goals in life are restricted by rulesâ€”the rules of [[nature]] and society.

What we call life is simply a collection of individual actions from birth to death. Since an [[action]] requires conscious movement, one can say that living starts when a child starts being more conscious of their actions.

However, life seems to start way before a child becomes conscious. At this time, the child is already "alive" but is not yet "living" or "acting" as both suggests action, and action requires consciousness.

Life can be a happy project (a game).
