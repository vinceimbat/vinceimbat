When you create [[evergreens]], it's important to [[fill permanent notes with links to other notes]] to create interconnections, which are the most important asset you build when you [[use a note-writing system]]. The most important links are those between permanent notes and [[structure notes]]. Whenever you [[write permanent notes about what you read to test understanding]], or for other purposes, connect the permanent note to a structure note, which can also be under a bigger structure note. This step makes sure that an individual note is connected to the biggest possible network of related notes. You can also do this when you [[create iterative outlines as you write notes]].
