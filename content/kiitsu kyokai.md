# Definition

Kiitsu kyōkai is made up of two Japanese words. The first word kiitsu ( 帰一 ) means "returning to oneness/unity." It is made up of two Japanese characters.

Ki (帰) means to return, revert, go back, or come home.
Itsu or ichi (一) means one, single, or unity.

The second word kyōkai ( 協会 ) is historically problematic. It is often translated as "assembly," "association," and "school." It is also made up of two Japanese characters.

Kyō means cooperation, association, or harmony.
Kai (会) means meeting, association, or society.

Kiitsu kyōkai has sometimes been translated as the "Unitarian Church."

Translations and uses of the word kyōkai to English reflects the inherent problems in the word [[church]].

# History

The first meeting of the post-war kiitsu kyōkai (second version) was held on October 23, 1948. However, it didn't officially form until about two years after.
