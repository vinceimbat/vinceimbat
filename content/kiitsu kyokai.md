>In Japanese, Kiitsu ( 帰一 ) means “returning” to “oneness” or “unity,” and Kyōkai 協会 means “assembly” or “association” with the associated idea of a “school”, i.e. a place where one gathers together in order to learn and grow. It has sometimes been translated as the “Unitarian Church.”

>Kiitsu Kyōkai was the name given to the post-1948 community founded in Tokyo by Imaoka Shin’ichirō-sensei (1881-1988), the twentieth-century Japanese advocate of jiyū shūkyō (自由宗教) which, although it is often translated as “free-religion” we feel is, today, better translated as “a creative, free-spirituality.”
