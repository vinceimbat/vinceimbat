I wanted to talk about something but I am afraid I am not allowed to talk about it. It seems like there is this general narrative - a certain topic and a certain way of talking about that topic - that I need to embrace if I would even give myself the chance of being heard. If I go against that narrative, I will risk not only being shunned but being completely deplatformed and canceled, muted so I won't be able to talk about anything again.

There is something I wanted to talk about. Something that moves me. That moves my heart. But I am keeping it to myself. If only it might still be able to see another light of day.
