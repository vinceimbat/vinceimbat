I will be using [[maslow heirarchy of needs|Maslow's hierarchy of needs]], as revised by [[Scott Barry Kaufman]], to sharpen my categorization in [[my life areas]]. I notice that there is already a stark similarity between the two:

|              | **Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs** | **My Life Areas**           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| **Growth**   | Transcendence                   | Life Work                   |
|              | Purpose                         |                             |
|              | Love                            |                             |
|              | Exploration                     |                             |
| **Security** | Self-esteem                     | Mental Health               |
|              | Connection                      | Relationships               |
|              | Safety                          | Physical Health, Sustenance |

I will continue to refine these categories through more thorough research.
