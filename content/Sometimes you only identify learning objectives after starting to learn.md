When learning a body of knowledge or a skill you completely don't know about, you won't be able to know exactly what you need to learn until you start learning per se, even after conducting an expert interview ([[Use expert interviews to identify best ways to learn a subject or skill]]).

This is what I experienced with photography. Even after talking with an expert, I wouldn't be discovering the specific things I need to focus on if I haven't just started taking photos and using them to complement my writing.

In instances where [[Metalearning]] does not seem to work before the learning itself, just start learning then apply [[Josh Kaufman]]'s advice to identify the minimum viable knowledge you need to acquire before you reach a level where you are comfortable enough to practice ans self-correct.
