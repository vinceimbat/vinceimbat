"Bathala nawa."

It is a phrase I sometimes hear friends say at the end of their sentences. The last time someone used it to me was on a recent Facebook comment. After a friend agreed to talk with me soon, he finished his comment with: "ingat kapatid. BHL NW" ("take care brother. BHL NW"). BHL NW, I intuited, was a vowel-less way of writing "Bathala nawa," which makes sense because the *baybayin*, the ancient Tagalog script uses no vowels.

My friends who use the phrase are from a very specific segment of people I know. These are people directly or loosely connected to a fairly recent movement to revive precolonial Filipino spirituality to integrate it into modern life.[^1]

"Bathala nawa" is a Tagalog phrase. I am yet to encounter a similar expression in Pangasinan, the language I spoke growing up. Admittedly, I haven't look at the phrase closely, but I know quite enough to make a few points about it.

The phrase consists of two Tagalog words: "Bathala" and "nawa." Bathala is the name of the most powerful god in Tagalog mythology. Like all the other ethnolinguistic groups in the Philippines, the Tagalogs have multiple gods, but Bathala is usually described as the most powerful of them all. Among the Igorots ("people of the mountain") in the northern Philippines, a similar god is called Kabunyian. The existence of an overpowering god like Bathala or Kabuniyan is perhaps one of several other reasons why the natives easily accepted Western monotheism's concept of the one true "God", leading to its dominance from the 1500s until the present.

On the other hand, "Nawa" is a word that is more difficult to define. In ancient Tagalog, as an adjective, it refers to something that isn't easily done. In contemporary usage, "nawa" expresses hope, as in "may it happen." Combining ancient and modern usage, one could understand "nawa" as an expression of hope that things that don't easily happen, happen. Taken as a whole, "Bathala nawa" could mean "May Bathala will it to happen." A Christianized interpretation I read somewhere interprets it as "May Bathala's will be done."

You won't hear this phrase used in current everyday Tagalog. However, a derivative of the phrase is one of the most common phrases in the language: "Bahala na."

"Bahala na" is what you would say when faced with a situation where almost everything is beyond your control and that certainty, especially of any favorable outcome, is impossible to accompish. You say "Bahala na" to recognize that you will do whatever is left for you to do, but that you are letting whoever has control of the rest ("Bathala") determine the outcome.

While I may sometimes use "bahala na," I use it stripped of any mythological or religious sense. I have never used the phrase "Bathala nawa" because, even if the phrase is situated outside the Christian tradition that has dominated the religious consciousness of these islands for more than five hundred centuries, it still is anchored to the belief than an all powerful being looking down at us somewhere in the sky rules our lives and dictates the trajectory of everything. While I've spent the first eighteen years of my life developing a relationship with such a being, it is a pursuit I have long since abandoned.

I've tried to avoid thinking about the idea of God since around 2012 when I left the Jehovah's Witnesses. After I left, I still encountered the word, of course. Like I said, theism, specifically monotheism is believed by the large majority of Filipinos. If I'm going to make an estimate, I would confidently say that around 99 percent of Filipinos are theists and almost all theists are monotheists.[^2] So, it is impossible to not encounter the idea. It is everywhere, and since I chose to hang around spiritual circles in search of the next best thing to fill the void left by my childhood faith, this meant I encountered the idea repeatedly even after leaving my religion.

When God was mentioned casually in conversations with friends and family throughout the years since 2012, the concept bore very little meaning to me. However, when it became the subject of more serious conversations, like when my friends philosophize over it or share their experiences of feeling God in their lives, old feelings about the concept are triggered and I felt very uncomfortable. My partner brought it up to me recently that whenever this happened, I usually grew silent and withdrew from the conversation.

When I give a long hard think about it, there was a point in my life when I stopped believing in God and another point when I stopped caring about God. When exactly these two things happened, I couldn't exactly say.

However, it is important to emphasize their difference. You could stop believing in God but that disbelief could spur you to think even more about the concept. Your disbelief becomes a fuel that motivates you to get to the bottom of it and find the truth about the nature of God.

But it is also very possible to stop believing about God and also stop caring about the matter. You stop thinking about God's characteristics and how God's existence is possible. As the years passed after leaving my childhood religion, I saw myself more and more as someone who no longer cares about the concept of God.

This distancing from a concept that once organized and directed my life is something I haven't completely reflected on. I have a good hunch that during all those years of ministry with the JWs, I built a relationship with this imaginary being that I strongly believed to be genuine, and that the breakage of this relationship was too emotionally hurtful to revisit. And so, like all other aspects of my previous religion, I avoided thinking about God.

It didn't help that I lacked the right people, the right community, to critically think about the concept of God. What I met were individuals who were already fully certain of their faith to this one true God, individuals who left no space for doubt in their religious or spiritual lives. Obviously, I have a big problem about this way of being in the world. Doubt was the very reason why I left the JWs. To disbelieve a certain worldview because of doubt only to immediately agree to another worldview doesn't seem reasonable to me. It defeats the purpose of why I left.

In retrospect, this lack of a shared safe space where I could confront my disbelief with God in a way that is sensitive to my past and honors all the process I went through just to get here was the number one reason why I avoided confronting the concept of God. Lacking this space but in need of community, I settled with available religious and spiritual communities who gave almost zero space to doubt and who never entertained liberal questions about their own beliefs.

So why am I 

Wanted to talk to something, converse, commune.

Nature

Rem

Reminds me of how I prayed in the past.

This desire to pray, to use words, not simply to create art but to commune and connect to an unfathomable reality is my internal motivation to return to the concept of God, to look out there for what is available, and to try to articulate for myself a working concept of this reality, which doesn't necessarily have to be called "God."

***

External motivation: Lea and others contending about metaphysical questions.

What I realized recently after talking with my partner weekly on walks is that while the Buddha was still wise in pointing out to tone down our need to make sense of metaphysics, some of us are only truly able to begin practicing a way of being in the world when we have clarified certain beliefs about wahat exists that we inherited from the religions of our parents.


- Describe how the walk with Lea made you realize you need to return to the idea of God.
	- Lea expressed how certain ideas taught to her growing up about what exists still bothers her today even
- Return to other reasons:
	- I am in the process of reintegrating several religious ideas into my new life.
	- But it was prayer that convinced me to confront God and give it a more serious look.
		- Enter here talking to Rem, a dead friend.
		- An urge to talk and return to my previous practice and the convenience to having someone to talk to.
- Reasons for avoiding the concept.
	- I noticed that talking about metaphysics with other people ends either to conflict or to careless thinking and proud certainty.
	- I was surrounded by people and communities of theists. No one was really skeptical that God exists.
- Why I'm opening up to it.
- My method
	- I will be combining reading with walking.
	- I'll be walking on the most accessible nature-filled walk: the Mt. Makiling Trail. I won't be walking to the summit, not yet. I'll be waking until Agila Base tops.
	- Instead of consecutive days of walking, I'll be doing a series of walks spread out through several weeks with a maximum of one walk per week of contemplation.
	- The first few walks will be purely recollections. After these recollections, I will be combining reading and walking, that is, I'll be reading a few days before the walk and hold these ideas during the walk as triggers to new lines of thought that the road will generate.
	- I'm not going to give a cap for the number of walks necessary to nail this. But here are a few ideas.
		- Walk 1: A recollection of my concept of God growing up as a child.
		- Walk 2: A recollection of ideas that made me disbelieve in God.
		- Walk 3: A recollection of my switch from radical atheism to tamed nontheism.
		- Walk 4: Pondering God as the immovable mover
		- Walk 5: Pondering God as nature
		- Walk 6: Pondering God as event
		- Etc.
	- I'll still combine photography and writing with the walks, but I will give priority on my thought process, so I'll be taking less photographs compared to previous walks.



[^1]: It has to be mentioned here that the concept of "Filipino spirituality" by itself is inherently problematic, because what is often described as Filipino is actually just one of the almost two hundred ethnolinguistic groups scattered across the Philippine archipelago. It is easy to make the mistake that Filipino culture is the culture of the people who live in Manila, the country's capital, and its surrounding provinces; a people called Tagalogs, or "people by the river."
[^2]: Data from the 2020 Census seems to confirm my hunch. According to the census, only 0.04 percent (or around 43,000) of Filipinos had no religious affiliation, a good predictor for atheism.
