Writing is the best facilitator for thinking both when consuming information and when generating ideas. If we want to really understand something, we have to be able to write it in our own words. This is why we need to [[write long before working on a publishable artifact]]. The presentation and the production of knowledge is inseparable; they both need to be done through writing. If it is the medium through which thinking happens, then we need to [[work as if nothing else counts than writing]].

# To do

- This is still a literature note. Cultivate it to become a permanent note.
