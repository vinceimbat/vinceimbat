Either God came from nothing or He came from something. When we answer that God came from something, nothing stops us from asking for the origin of that something that He came from and so on. This leads to an infinite regress, which leads some to conclude that God came from infinity.

Now, by logical necessity, [[Infinity cannot exist]]. If infinity does not exist, God, therefore, should have come from nothing. This is difficult to wrap our heads around because we are so used of cause and effect. But either we become awe-inspired by something that is logically true (finity: God was the start) or something that is logically false (infinity: God was here all along).
