See situations where you are triggered to be angry as opportunities to practice calm and reason. Be grateful for the opportunity. And because such opportunities are very rare, do everything in your ability to leave the situation with flying colors (i.e., not triggered nor angered, but calm). Reflect on the situation after the fact, and, perhaps most importantly, prepare for these situations before they even occur.
