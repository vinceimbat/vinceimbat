If the person you love doesn't love you, it's time to reject the rejector. It's the only way you will move on.

Things that prevent us from doing this

1. Believing that there is something you can do that will make the person care about you again.

This is the wrong time to do this.

You shouldn't be changing so that someone will love you.

You must know who you are, you must be confident that you are the right person for the right person who will appreciate you.

Number 1 requirement for a partner: she wants to be with me, doesn't want to leave me, loves me, thinks i am the best thing

If the person left, she no longer fulfills the list. They're not the right person for you.

Only change if you really have thought that doing so will save an important relationship, or your other relationships and people have brought it up to you.

It's a wrong time to change when what you are thinking is that I should have changed so that someone didn't leave me.

It's time to focus on you.

You should realize that you're a pretty good deal. Someone should be glad to have you.

Spend the time between relationships to work on you for you and for the right person

Not for the person who walked out the door

Even of you are full of pain, remember, your soulmate would not do what this person did to you.
