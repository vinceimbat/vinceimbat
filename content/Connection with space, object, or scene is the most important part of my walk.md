What I am really looking for in walks are the magical moments, which usually happen during a slow walk. During these magical moments, I expereince a profound connection with a space, object, or scene. When I am in this connected state, I know I am in the zone. This being in the zone happens best not in the highway, but in trails that allow me to be alone, comfortable, and silent.

Realizing this, perhaps it is not the long walks that are most appropriate with what I want to do but short philosophical walks taken on silent trails at a specific place. To experience this profound connection, stay in that place in an extended period for a few days to an entire week.
