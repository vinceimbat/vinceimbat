Asked Andrew about his thoughts with getting an MA. Was it helpful?

Make the writing practice gentle and fun

# My mission statement

I believe in freedom.
I believe in community.
I believe in seeing things as they really are.
I believe in positionlessness.
I believe in compassion.
I believe in simplicity.

Through writing inspired by walking, I want to elevate everyday subjective human experiences and help others access depth and meaning from them.

I craft words and images that help others experience true freedom safeguarded by a universal community.

I craft words and images that invite people to think deeply about human freedom, community, and nature.

I craft walk-inspired words and images that invite people to think and experience deeply what freedom and community mean in the context of nature.
