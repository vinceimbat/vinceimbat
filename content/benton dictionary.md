This dictionary is more recent than the [[Cosgaya dictionary]], although it has now entered the public domain (?). It is in English. The words listed in this dictionary are way lesser that those in the Cosgaya dictionary, and it misses even common words used today. There are better and more recent dictionaries made by Pangasinenses themselves. But since they are inaccessible, I use Benton.
