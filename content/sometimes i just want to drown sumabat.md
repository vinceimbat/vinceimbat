This is the first zine of [[Benj Gabun Sumabat]], a co-fellow from [[PRS17]]. It's made up of four poems, three of which were originally written in Iloko and were translated to English, Filipino, and Bisaya by other translators, including [[Junley Lazaga]].

Benj's words were accompanied by photographs of Jeho Caluma.
