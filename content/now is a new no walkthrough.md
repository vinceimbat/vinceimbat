# A Walkthrough of Now is a new no

1. Figures of Manila: Manila as an archipelagic and a patchwork city.
2. Aesthetic strategies in Now is a new no: image-text, citation, and collage
3. Walking as a method of creative production
4. Poetry reading
5. Open forum

Island studies, Vince is slowly getting into it.
Cities can be described as islandic.
Predominantly social science perspective.

## Aesthetic strategies in Now is a new no

Contentious relations between pictures and text.
Source of photos: Ateneo archives

Word and picture as rivals

Picture Theory by WJT Mitchell
- pluralize image text relations

Vince doesn't know the reactions on his work.

Strategy of citation.
- quoting and remixing quotations
- it is a powerful tool and strategy
- citation is processual not gatekeeping knowledge or being territorial

He was starting to write Now is a new no around 2015.

Juxtapose materials together and see if they converse.

Collage
- once you gathered materials from citation, quotation, photographing, describing things while walking.
- Putting together gathered materials.
- relating the material to the origin + relating it to its new whole

How are we connecting these fragments?

## Walking as a method of creative production

Gain immediacy, sensual knowledge.
You feel both alienated and liberated.

Walking in relation to language

## Poetry reading

Itinerary
- born out of a visit to Manila Hotel in 2012

Static
- what would radio static say had it been given a voice

## Open forum

1. Poetry is thought of as more spontaneous. But you did more research and theory.

In poetry there are a lot of expectations to be brief and expressive.

He prefers poems that have longer forms.
Vince pluralizes the definition of poetry.

2. Time and space

3. Collage

At the beginning just intuition.
Editing: moved some quotations 

4. Black and white

Retrospection, vintage feel
Influenced by Lav Diaz

5. Hazardous areas; walking on areas wiped of history

There are was to historicity of a place even if it is wiped of tangible proofs.

6. I'm curious if you could speak more about the role of the reader in your poetry. Your poetry is ensconced in this idea of walking as a means for creative production and it makes me wonder about how readers are likewise engaged in walking this textual locus and re-making the poem - amidst the images, the citations, and the juxtaposition of different styles of writing (lyric, prose-poem)?

You don't have to read linearly.
You can only look at the photos.
Read Static separately or as one.

7. Hi sir! May I ask how do you balance writing/make time for writing given your other roles as teacher and editor among others? Thank you!

Poetry comes secondary

8. Hello! I am new to your work, thank you for sharing. May I ask if there is something significant that youâ€™ve learned about yourself in the experience of coming up with these creations? (Perhaps also in relation to poetry, photography and book-making?)

You need to be infinitely curious. He has walked many times and each time he learns something new. Curious about materials and process of composition.

In Manila, land is the embodiment of social and economic conflict.

9. I am interested in the transition from prose poetry to lyrical poetry in your new book. How did you make artistic judgements on that transition? That seems to be the most abrupt change to me. Why the decision of lyrical-picture-prose poetry too? Not other combinations?

Personal reading: He read poets who wrote poet prose (Conchitina Cruz, Susan Howe)

Question
1. How did the collage making happen? Was it physical? As in cutting citations and moving them around in the table and pasting them on paper as in a physical collage? Or did you do this digitally or wrote this spontaneously on the page?
