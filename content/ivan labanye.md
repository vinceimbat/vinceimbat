Member/leader of [[pedantic pedestrians]]. [[UPB]] BALL and MALL student who relocated to [[los banos|Los Ba√±os]] in 2023 and whom I met through [[Jesa Suganob]] although I've seen his face many times back in UPB.

Ivan was a columnist at the Baguio Chronicler. He compiled his columns and turned them into a book in 2024: [[beckoning baguio labanye|Beckoning Baguio]].

- Consultation about organizing in Pangasinan:
	- Yes, easier if onsite but collabs could still be done apart.
	- Gumil: bridges old and young writers.
	- Could penetrate an existing institution then hope for change.
	- Or create an anarchic group like [[pedantic pedestrians]] with no organizational structure and do your thing freely.
