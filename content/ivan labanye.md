Member/leader of [[Pendantic Pedestrians]]. [[UPB]] BALL and MALL student who relocated to [[los banos|Los Ba√±os]] in 2023 and whom I met through [[Jesa Suganob]] although I've seen his face many times back in UPB.

Ivan was a columnist at the Baguio Chronicler. He compiled his columns and turned them into a book in 2024: [[beckoning baguio labanye|Beckoning Baguio]].
