Metalearning means learning about learning. We perform metalearning to create a personalized plan for a [[Self-directed learning]] project ([[Ultralearning, after Young]]). Metalearning prevents us from getting lost or choosing a learning path unwisely. The more we practice meta-learning, the better we do it in subsequent projects (i.e., in gathering resources, time management, managing motivation, and building confidence).

[[Do metalearning by asking why, what, and how]]. For an example of how meta-learning was used in writing, see [[How James Clear used ultralearning to improve his writing]].
