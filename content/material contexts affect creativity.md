Thesis: how we think, create, and exist in the world depends a lot on our material contexts.

Instead of a book project, focus on slowly setting up your material ecosystem (source of money, place, house, technology). This also involves changing my habits to match this new lifestyle (eating, media consumption, use of time).

While doing this transition, use the website to document your journey. In a way, my very own Walden project.

Connect with the right people.

# On walking

Deep walking seems to be the obvious choice for someone trying to have as little connection with the exchange economy as possible.

I wonder how I could walk the Philippines without incurring a lot of money. How this connects with my overall goals.

How does walking change the way I live and create art?

Definitely go to walking excursions. The challenge is perhaps how to design these excursions in the most lean and environment-friendly ways?
- the creative goal has to be lean
- The goal is to have as few possessions in my bag as possible. But I'm still able to produce good work.

Your main interest seems to be in the relationship of the material and the immaterial.
- your experiment thinks about how material context and tools inform mental activities.
- Walking traverses both mental and physical.

Develop a calendar for excursions. Dedicate time for rest and just being at home.
