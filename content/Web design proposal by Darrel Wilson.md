## Darrel Wilson

## Proposal
- A proposal is a detailed summary of what the project will entail. After reading your proposal, the client should have a better understanding of who you are as a service provider and how you can help them solve their problems.

## What is included in the proposal?
- Identify their problem that needs solving.
- Show how you will solve the problem.
- Show the web design process, including a detailed timeline, in a way that they understand
- Show relevant informatin about you and the project (?)
- Include a price and an opportunity for them to sign it.

## Structure

Adjust the style and tone of your proposal based on your client.
- For a simple proposal, just send a proposal with options.
- For big comanies, you want to really be detailed because there is a lot of money involved.

1. Introduce yourself
2. Identify client's problems
3. Show approach on how to fix the problem
4. Timeline and what you will do (should also include a quote to help your client understand why you quoted the price).
5. Show example works and portfolio.
6. Sign and pay me
7. Include an option for recurring.
8. Include a link to a contract or agreement.

## Tips
- Make everything personal (headlines, etc.)

## Should you ask you clients what their budget is?

PROS
- Weeds out cheap clients
- Saves you time and hassle

CONS
- Could make client feel cheated
- Could make client uncomfortable
- Could make you lose your client
- Cut Off Dilemma: Client says 4k is limit, but you propose 5k and they would almost always say yes.
