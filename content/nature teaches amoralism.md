Nature is this calm retreat away from societyâ€”from the world. It teaches objectivity, tolerance, seeing things as they truly are, mindfulness. There are things so difficult to go by in society. The life I want to live is one of health, contemplation, a rich relationship with a few people, and being in nature more.

But because nature is objective, it can be harsh and incompassionate. That said, since the mind arose from nature and it is capable of compassion, one could make the argument that Nature is also capable of compassion.
