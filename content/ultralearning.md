Ultralearning is a [[strategy]] for learning hard subjects and acquiring skills in relatively short time, popularized by [[scott young|Scott Young]] in his book [[ultralearning young|by the same name]]. It applies [[self-directed learning]] and intensity while prioritizing effectivity. Since it is self-directed, it is less wasteful in time and effort and is also more flexible. You can do it part-time, full-time, or as an integral part of your current schedule.

There are [[nine universal principles of ultralearning]].
