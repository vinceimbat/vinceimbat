Nicole divides her finances into two categories:

1. Cash
2. Investments

She tracks these two categories separately.

Her Cash is further divided into three:

1. On-hand
2. Bank
3. E-wallets

Her On-hand Cash is further divided into two:

1. On-the-go wallet
2. Home wallet

She has several banks

- Unionbank (open an account online)
- High-interest savings accounts: Gsave, Ppsave, ING (digital banks with high interest and no maintaining balance). Use these high interest banks for your emergency fund and goals you are saving up for the future.

Her e-wallets include:

1. Gcash
2. Paymaya
3. [Coins.ph](http://Coins.ph)
4. Grabpay (similar with Paymaya but probably has more points)
5. Paypal

Nicole has excellent advice on [[How to be safe when online shopping]] using e-wallets.
