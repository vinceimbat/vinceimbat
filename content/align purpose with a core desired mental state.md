By choosing a [[core desired mental state]] as your [[purpose]], you align reality with your desire. People don't always see this possibility (cf. [[a purpose is not always a core desired mental state]]), but [[align purpose with a core desired mental state]] (cf. [[The quality of my entire life is the quality of my habitual emotions - Tony Robbins#^2452AEF7-AE08-4222-8322-DBA53109BCA9]]).
