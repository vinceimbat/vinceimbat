A wonderful book that heavily influenced [[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown's]] personal studies and religious trajectory.

Christian faith is the attempt to unify the subjective and the objective (i.e., the eternal) into one through a subject's passionâ€”absurd passion, which is [[faith]]. Edwards differentiates this from the "pagan" way of approaching the eternal, which is by using reason.
