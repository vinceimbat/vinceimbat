- [[thoughts/walking in cablong]]

when walking here in cablong in areas where i dont know the people and they are sitting on the side of the road, i feel uneasy. People here know everyone and so when someone is a bisita, they know. And they unintentionally express this by looking at you almost watching you walk. In this circumstance walking really becomes a performance.

Feeling unease with this, I prefer walking alone in paths unfrequentes by humans.

Note the difference, the comfort I feel when walking in more urban spaces where I am hidden in a sea of anonymity even when I walk amid hundreds of people.

Burning dry grass and weeds on the right side of the road

Instead of plants, seeds are places that one return to again and again

Now walking in night in the middle of rice fields. Could anything beat this?
