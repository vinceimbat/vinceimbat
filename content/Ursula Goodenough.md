Ursula Goodenough didn't have a really good answer to the question what is religion or spirituality. (Read her book!)

I found it interesting that she got into the field without any theological or possibly philosophical background. She was simply a scientist.

The best thing I took from her though is her argument that a belief in God is simply what I would call an add-on. It isn't necessary, she says, in living a "moral" life. Being in nature, feeling in awe of creation and the meta narrative of evolution should be enough to spur one into moral action. Having a God is not necessary although she understands why some people need that.
