There are three stages in acquiring a skill.
1. **Cognitive (early) stage.** This is when you articulate your learning objectives, thinking about the means towards those objectives, and making those objectives manageable. This seems to coincide with [[Metalearning]].
2. **Associative (intermediate) stage.** This stage involves acting on the roadmap identified in the previous stage. It concerns [[Deliberate practice]] ([[Practice is necessary in acquiring skill and knowledge]]) and adjusting one's learning approach based on feedback from the practice ([[Acquire just enough learning to deliberately practice and self-correct]]).
3. **Autonomous (late) stage.** This is the stage when one becomes a master. When one has reached this stage, some areas of the skill becomes intuitive and can even be done without too much attention.
