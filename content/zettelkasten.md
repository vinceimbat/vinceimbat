Zettelkasten is a German word that roughly traslates to “slip-box.” Not everyone agrees to this translation. It is a note-writing system famous for fuelling the scholarship of [[niklas luhmann]]. [[thoughts/sonke ahrens]]' book [[_notes/02 Talahardin/How to Take Smart Notes - Ahrens]] is considered the best entry point book for the system in English. I think the most intuitive version of the system for the Internet age is [[andy matuschak]]'s [[Evergreen note-taking system]]. Many consider the website [Zettelkasten](https://zettelkasten.de/) as the best source of practical information on modern-day applications of the process.

To see how Luhmann used the Zettelkasten, see [[Luhmann's Zettelkasten Manual]]. While heavily similar, there might be subtle nuances in [[Ahren's Zettelkasten Manual]].

My own version of this system is [[talahardin]].
