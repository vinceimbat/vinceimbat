Braided essay that weaves two things:
1. A narrative of a love story that ended in a break up set in Los Ba√±os.
2. An exploration of the idea of the forest in Filipino literature, history, and politics.

What makes this work different:
- Experimental use of numbered paragraphs.
- Published "work in progress"
