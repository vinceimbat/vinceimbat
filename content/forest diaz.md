An unconventional book by award-winning author [[glenn diaz|Glenn Diaz]]. It was published by [[paper trails|Paper Trails]].

Braided essay that weaves two things:

1. A narrative of a love story that ended in a break up set in Los Baños.
2. An exploration of the idea of the forest in Filipino literature, history, and politics.

What makes this work different:
- Experimental use of numbered paragraphs.
- Published "work in progress"

It's a hybrid essay, a braided one that interlocks a narrative of Glenn's romantic relationship with an LB-based artist he only identifies by little details, such as that he had an old home at Forestry and that he has transitioned to curation, and a trek-like wandering on the subject of forests. This is the personal essay—perhaps the essay—at its best: meandering, trying to create a path through the wilderness. Among the subjects he encounters in the ? are the forests' relationship with agriculture, colonial scientific forestry, kaingin, the NPA retreat to the forests, forests in Rizal's writings, and LB's Department of Forestry.
