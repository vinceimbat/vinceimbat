If you are gonna build something. Build something useful.

Some ideas for websites someone ought to build:

1. An online Pangasinan working dictionary. It doesn't have to be official. It just have to be good enough, so that writers can start writing better in the language.
2. A comprehensive website categorizing filipino lit according to genre, subject matter, etc. i am always asking: is there a pinoy book on this or that topic?
