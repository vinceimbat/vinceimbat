[[Andy Matuschak]] uses this term to refer to all notes that bring structure to his [[Evergreen note-taking system]]. In short, this is his term of art for [[Structure notes]]. He doesn't seem to make any distinction within this category. [[Sascha Fast]], on the other hand, thinks that outline notes are a special kind of structure note—one that is associated to a specific writing project (i.e., one with a goal of producing a publishable artifact).

Andy’s advice is to [[Create iterative outlines as you write notes]].

To do
- Convert this note into something that is truly yours. Remove references to Andy and Sascha. Embrace it as yours.
- But differentiate it from structure notes.

   Outline notes are for writing projects.

   When I have a note that is the starting point of an article I paste it into my org and write a short outline for an article.

   Outline notes are a special kind of structure notes.
