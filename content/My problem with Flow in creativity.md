MY PROBLEM WITH THE IDEA OF "FLOW" IN CREATIVITY

I have a big, big problem with this idea of flow in creativity. This idea that something out of me, not me, is pouring the ideas into my head and that I take no ownership on any of them. When I believe this, I feel like a passive, impotent creator. No, I am not even a creator in this framework. I am simply a slave, an unconscious temporary container for this God or Divine power or Muse who does the thinking or creating for me.

I beg to disagree.

I recognize that insights and ideas come to me in unnexpected moments. I do not have absolute control over my thoughts, and this phenomenon feels "mystical" more often than not. But I am not ONLY a channel. I am not ONLY a medium. I refuse to denegrate my role in all of these. I am an ACTIVE CO-CREATOR of the children of my mind. They are MY children even if I am not their only parent. The reason being that I am fully conscious when the pouring is happening. I am there catching every single word, image, and sensation. And that I am there, say, instead of you, makes me a unique active participant in this process. And when I edit the words and think about them and organize them into a more beautiful form, am I not showing the world I am an active cocreator?

Of course, being a cocreator of my creations means that I am partly to be held responsible for where these creations end up. In other words, it is impossible to be totally unattached to them and how the world accepts them. But I would rather suffer the pain of that responsibility than accept that I have no active part in bringing them into the world.
