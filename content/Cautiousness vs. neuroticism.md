A lot of my actions and choices exhibit cautiousness.

1. I am slow to commit to anything pertaining to my life work.
2. I have a conservative approach with my beliefs. I am skeptical of a lot of things.
3. I want to take things slowly with people, ideally one person at a time.

My cautiousness is a manifestation of my [[Introversion]]. Cautiousness works for me and I want to fully embrace it. What I find difficult to work with is my [[Neuroticism]].

1. Because of my neuroticism, an initial cautiousness in my lifework leads to fear, procrastination, and low self-confidence.
2. Because of my neuroticism, my skepticism of beliefs make me more judgmental, critical, and sometimes angry.
3. Because of my neuroticism, I avoid social situations that could improve my life (video calls, public speaking, meeting people).

How can I work around or with my neuroticism? Some ideas:

- Be open about it to my audience. This will illustrate the fact that in our journeys there will be obstacles. We could transform those obstacles into assets by using them to tell us what we truly want and tell us the skills we need to learn.
