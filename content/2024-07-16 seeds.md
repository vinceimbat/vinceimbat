I would like to commit to the following:

Jiyu shukyo
Writing (specifically, spiritual writing)
Walking

***

If this is the case, make the contest entries spiritual. Curate your writing life according to this spirituality. This is the authenticity you are looking for.

Shape your writing life not existing shapes shape you.

The core of your focus are:
- Jiyu shukyo
- Contemplative/spiritual writing
- Walking

I need to focus. I need to review DIY MFA for a plan.
