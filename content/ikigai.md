Ikigai is interesting because it attempts to combine almost all needs in [[maslow heirarchy of needs]] into a single project or activity.

According to [[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown]], this word has been often misappropriated. In [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka's]] Creed of Life, ikigai is translated as "the worth of living in life." I love this translation. It is both [[purpose|purpose]] and [[meaning|meaning]]. It is very existential as it seems to present itself as a reason to convince me not to kill myself.
