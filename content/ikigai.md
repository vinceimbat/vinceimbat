Ikigai is interesting because it attempts to combine almost all needs in [[maslow heirarchy of needs|Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] into a single [[project]] or activity.

According to [[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown]], this word has been often misappropriated. In [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka's]] [[imaoka principles of living|Principles of Living]], ikigai is translated as "the worth of living in life." I love this translation. It is both [[purpose|purpose]] and [[meaning|meaning]]. It is very existential as it seems to present itself as a reason to continue living.

According to Imaoka's first principle of living, one's ikigai is found by being awakened to three things that characterize the [[self]], namely:
- subjectivity, which he also called autonomy or personality
- creativity or divinity
- sociality or Buddhahood

Intuitively as it all stands now, I feel like I've found my ikigai. This is captured by the following statements:
- [[my purpose statement]]
- [[my vision statement]]
- [[my mission statement]]

I now have a deeper understanding of myself, I've found convergence on what activities I enjoy doing and plan on investing on, and I have an existing community I could minister on and practice what I'm learning with.
