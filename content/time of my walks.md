Interestingly, while researching more about the word _lilim_, I discovered that its Pangasinan equivalent, _sirom_, is a synonym of the Tagalog word _dapithapon_ or sunset. _Sirom_ is also a Hiligaynon and Waray word, which means the same thing. Therefore, _lilim_ is not just the shade of trees that I have taken refuge on during many of my walks and bike rides. _Lilim_ is also the time when I took those walksâ€”a time when I would often be alone in the middle of fields as farmers go home after a long day of work.

At that time, clouds are also more mature, much bigger, creating welcomed shades that block the sun--a phenomenon called by the similarly sounding Tagalog word _lilom_. The best _lilom_ would create beautiful sceneries in the sky: celestial halos, long sun rays, and the much-awaited mackerel sky
