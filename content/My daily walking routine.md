I use walking to hit multiple goals ([[Walking accomplishes multiple goals]]). I take daily walks to make progress in several areas of interests.

However, the most important goal when walking is to attempt to be in a poetic state of mind, to be in the zone, and from there make myself more open for [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy]]. To do this, I follow [[thoughts/my thinking while walking strategy]].

After feeling satisfied with my philosophical walking, I then switch to walking for fitness and getting my 10,000 steps for the day.
