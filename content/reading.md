Reading is such an important part of my [[understanding]] process, specifically [[my studying process]].

My reading process follows classic [[Getting Things Done]] method:

1. Collect: I [[use a reading inbox to capture useful reading materials]]. I am mindful in adding materials here, though. I follow some [[guidelines on what to add to your reading inbox]].
3. Process: For a detailed presentation, see [[how to manage a reading inbox]]. I review my reading inbox weekly as part of [[my weekly review routine]] to delete materials that I will no longer read. The materials I do read, especially those for learning ([[decide whether to read for fun or for learning]]), are read with the intention of taking notes ([[reading without note-taking is only beneficial in the short-term]])
4. Organize: I archive everything I read. I detailed how I do archiving for each reading material type in the note detailing the implementation of [[my reading inbox]].

# To Do

1. Use the notes on reading in [[protheus seybold]] to enrich this note.

Integrate:

Thoreau’s reading method highlighted focus: the heart of the matter.

- The heart of the matter is what answered to one’s individual genius.
- He read but accepted only what was for oneself.
- One could also read one’s own meaning in another’s words.
- Read to look for ideas that are strictly your own.
