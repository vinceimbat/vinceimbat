Selfish needs will only be satisfied up to the point where no one is stepping on other people's lives. Freedom does not have to be maximized and it never will. What is important is agility, flexibility, negotiation, and compromise. Find a way to harmonize inner desire with other people's interests and learn to coexist with those with conflicting interests.
