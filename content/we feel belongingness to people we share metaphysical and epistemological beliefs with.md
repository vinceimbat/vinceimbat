[[thoughts/buddha avoided metaphysics]]. He said it was unimportant and that it prevented us from being compassionate to each other. Overemphasizing our beliefs in [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[thoughts/epistemology]] can definitely make us hateful especially when the two are combined into one ideology. [[thoughts/we agree about what we want and disagree about metaphysics and epistemology]] But [[thoughts/metaphysics and epistemology can help us be kinder]]. It will always be part of our conversation about how to relate with other people.

For example, I want to clarify my metaphysical and epistemological beliefs because I first need to create a place of belonging within myself. I first need to feel at home in my body. I want to feel really safe and autonomous and to protect that safe space as much as I can. And from there, expand my sense of belonging. The challenge is of course compassionâ€”to love people outside that circle of belonging that we are ever so interested in building and preserving.

This is the reason why building my worldview through [[thoughts/understanding]] is so important to me and why my immediate environment is so important to me and why I want to be careful and intentional in my relationships.
