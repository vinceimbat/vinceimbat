Somehow, I see [[writing]] in my [[diary]] as something sacred, reverent, and venerable. And perhaps it is. For many years it has helped me go through a lot of things. It has brought me to many places. The words that started here has become notes on my [[talahardin]], which in turn became [[essays]] and [[newsletters]]. So yes, I will continue to treat writing on my journal as one of those sacred things that needs to be respected, observed, and most importantly enjoyed.

The little time I spend here everyday, especially when I only cover a page is a period of silence, presence, and introspection, and I should do my best to make it that way for as many days as I could. Also, a journal has to be  a safe place. Doing it shouldn't stress you and you can ensure this by writing in your journal with no intention of showing off.
