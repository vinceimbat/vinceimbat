To read for learning:

1. Pick up a reading material from your [[reading inbox]].
2. Add the reference details of that material in your reference manager ([[use a reference manager]]) like [[zotero]].
3. If reading a book, add steps from [[talahardin cycle for a book]].
4. Read the material naturally without skipping any parts. Highlight passages that stand out (i.e, useful text that is either difficult or easy to understand).
5. Along with highlighting, write [[literature notes]] ([[how to write literature notes]]) on a temporary note in [[craft]].
6. After reading, export all highlights into the note in Craft.
7. Read the highlights and literature notes then start developing [[evergreens]] using them ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]).
8. Add reference details to each permanent note that uses the reference material.
9. Include exact passages you used to write the permanent notes under each reference.
10. Copy all literature notes to Zotero as a note.

This process is inspired by the [[barbell method of reading]].
