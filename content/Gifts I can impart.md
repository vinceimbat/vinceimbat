If the life is the gift received, then it is the gift to be shared through deeds, words, stories, and learnings.

What parts of my story can be shared?
- The depression
- Leaving my religion
- Explorations in atheism
- Explorations in Eastern spirituality
- Discovering philosophy
- Integrating everything into a life practice

Instead of searching forward to gift what I don't have, search backward into the forest that I have already walked and yet neglected.
