Seek validation in reaching one person and engaging with them deeply. Focus on one person at a time. Begin to do this long before you even create or launch your work. If you already have an audience in front of you, start with them.

This could change the momentum of your creative life.

Your task is to:
1. Learn where your people hang out
2. Learn what they need
3. Learn what they love
4. Learn how they want to engage
5. Learn how they relate to your creative work (or existing things similar to yours)
6. Engage with them directly one by one

What does engagement look like?
1. Seek out small conversations
2. Perform tiny ways of helping
3. Have meaningful conversations
4. Share
5. Show empathy

Develop your own practices and routines to reach out to members of your audience.
