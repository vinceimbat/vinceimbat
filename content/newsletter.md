I currently have one active newsletter.

# The Long Walk

The Long Walk is a weekly newsletter that shares artifacts I find during my walks both in geographic space and in what I like to call “the wilderness of the mind.”

# Archived Newsletter

I have two archived newsletters both of which are now integrated in T*he Long Walk*.

## Lilim

_Lilim_, which means "shade" or "shadow," used to be a bi-weekly newsletter about walking in Laguna, Pangasinan, and elsewhere in the Philippines. My walk narratives are now integrated with *The Long Walk* and are only published when available.

## Uman

_Uman_ means "change." It is a monthly newsletter sent every first week of the month, documenting what it means to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and writing independently as a way of life.
