Craig Mod is a writer and photographer from Japan. He blogs at craigmod.com. He’s like a modern-day [[henry david thoreau]] who walks and writes, except he’s not too particular with philosophy and is more interested in culture, literature, and story-telling. That is why he talked to other people, unlike Thoreau or [[annie dillard]] who engaged more with [[nature]] and, thus, talked more to themselves. (Note: How much should I talk to people I meet on my walks?)

What I think I can steal from his process is how he organizes long-walks and create publishable artifacts from those walks.

# How CM creates a book

Cm

Not only before lunch

Internet goes off automatically by 10 pm

Why? When u are writing a book, your mind works outside of clear book writing sessions. When u do internet stuff outside of book writing sessions u deprive urself of that.

Cm has a 10,000 people email list before launching sp

Connecting the books with the membership was the advertising

Unprocessed

John McBride was his mentor.
Looked for a deeper meaning on being in Japan.

2012 did the kumano kodo walk
2019 walk that turned to kissa by kissa was what started his walk as a platform model

He is no allowed to complain during walks.
Elevate people he meets.
