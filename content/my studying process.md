The [[talahardin]] cycle refers to the holistic process of using the system in engaging with information and generating knowledge. It is a cycle because the end of one loop informs the next. The phases of this cycle are:

1. [[metalearning]]
2. [[reading]], highlighting, and taking [[literature notes]]
3. Reading highlights and writing [[evergreens]]
4. Developing [[Structure notes]], [[Outline notes]], or drafts
5. Reflecting ([[my daily review routine]])

The cycle can be done in two ways:
1. [[thoughts/talahardin cycle for a book]]
2. [[Talahardin cycle as one study session]]
