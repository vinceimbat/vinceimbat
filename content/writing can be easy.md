Ease can be used as an organizing principle when [[writing]]. If we don’t have to use willpower, we set ourselves to success. [[a note-writing system makes writing easier|A note-writing system makes writing easier]] and we can set these up in such a way that we use less willpower.

Our system should allow us to do two things:

1. Stop when we're stuck and do something else.
2. Not force us to do anything we don’t want to do.

Ironically, we can create an impressive body of work not in spite of writing with ease but because of it, as [[niklas luhmann|Niklas Luhmann]] did.

One way to make writing easy is to [[break down your work into small and clearly separated tasks]].

# To do
