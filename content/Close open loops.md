An open loop is an actionable information item that is not yet clarified and organized. [[open loops]] are detrimental to productivity due to the [[zeigarnik effect]], so we need to close them.

If it's a task that can be done in two minutes, finish it (see [[thoughts/david allen]]’s [[Two-minute rule]]). If the task is more time-consuming, [[Close open loops by externalizing them]]. Write them down as [[fleeting notes]] and put them in an [[inboxes to capture fleeting notes]], where you can easily retrieve them for review on a later time. However, if you have externalized these open loops and stored them in an inbox, it is important that [[efficient inboxes are reliably drained]], otherwise they won't work.
