The bulk of my work will be internalâ€”[[meditation]], [[contemplation]], and practicing right action. The main work is inner work. It is mind work. It involves mastering meditation, which develops [[mindfulness]], concentration, and mental stability. It involves deep thinking or contemplation to develop [[understanding]], which also benefits from mindfulness. It involves practicing [[compassion]] in daily life, the ultimate application of mindfulness and contemplation ([[understanding leads to compassion]]). This inner work also includes taking care of my physical body.

Outer work, which involves [[sharing]], [[thoughts/connecting]], and [[facilitating]], bring the boost that inner work needs. [[Outer work enhances inner work]]. They enhance the positive emotions generated by pure inner work. One can say that we fulfill our inner work fully by performing our outer work.
