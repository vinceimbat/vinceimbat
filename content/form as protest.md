Lacaba's "The Annotated Catechism" is autonomous because of its form. At the same time, its form is its protest to the status quo.

[[talahardin]] because of its publication of [[draft|drafts]] and its use of tech that go against the status quo (open-source) and platforms used by Big tech companies, become a critique to the system.

My Buhian essay was talking mostly about form (the draft, walk-inspired writing). So perhaps just bank into it as an overarching principle to simplify the discussion.
