- [[i was waiting]]

I was waiting
I was waiting
While everybody else is coasting
But it didn't matter
Because I was with you

Now that you're gone
I'm just waiting
While everybody else is coasting
And it matters
Because no one tells me
It's okay

I don't need to know the name of the star for me to resonate with it.

I wrote the following affirmation on my Obsidian's daily note:

> "I am not my livelihood. I have done a lot to transform my life, my inner life, and that is where my real work is. That is where I should worry whether I am doing well or not."
