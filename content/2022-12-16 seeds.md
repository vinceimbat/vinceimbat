- [[poems/i was waiting]]

I was waiting
I was waiting
While everybody else is coasting
But it didn't matter
Because I was with you

Now that you're gone
I'm just waiting
While everybody else is coasting
And it matters
Because no one tells me
It's okay

I dont need to know the name of the star for me to resonate with it.
