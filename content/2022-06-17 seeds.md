The sunflowers are withering. They looked burnt by the sun. That's weird for their name. These cosmos are beautiful with those structures as their background. Walking in Jamboree road at night is risky. There are almost no lights and there are no side walks to walk through. Lea and I have no choice but to walk on the left side just to see what is approaching us. And, of course, there is the risk of the guards not allowing us to enter, which won't happen because I will talk back.
