He described himself in the following words: “I’m a pedestrian, nothing more.”

Rimbaud’s history of walking can be summarized as follows:

- 15-17 years old: Rimbaud walked to great cities, specifically Paris, where he tried to reach many times but failed because of lack of money to pay for transportation. He wanted to reach Paris to become a poet and integrate himself in the literary community. He also walked to Brussels to be a journalist.
- 20-24 years old: Rimbaud walked many times to the South, only returning home for the Winter.
- 25-37 years old: Rimbaud walked in desert roads for business.

Rimbaud walked a lot throughout his entire life until his leg had to be amputated. He died waiting for his wooden leg to arrive.

Rimbaud's walks best exemplified that [[Walking is leaving]].

> Between the ages of fifteen and seventeen, he walked to reach great cities: the Paris of literary hopes, to become known in Parnassian circles, to meet poets like himself, desperately lonely and longing to be loved (read his poems). To Brussels, to pursue a career in journalism. Between twenty and twenty-four, he several times tried the route to the South, returning home for the winter. Preparation for travel … There were incessant shuttles between Mediterranean ports (Marseille or Genoa) and Charleville; walking towards the sun. And from the age of twenty-five until his death, desert roads.

> On 3 September he managed to note in a firm, unshaky hand: ‘I am awaiting the artificial leg. Send it to me at once when it arrives, I am in a hurry to get away from here.’
