These are the exact quotes from the first book of Cortes' trilogy on [[Pangasinan]] history that forever changed how I looked at [[San Jacinto]] and [[Manaoag]].

The first quote in p. 9 was the first to trigger imaginations of a forest between San Jacinto and Manaoag.

>The Anluragat, Ymanduyan, and Campa rivers all flow past the town of Claris, cross the road leading from Binalonan to Manaoag, and disappear into the forests between Manaoag and San Jacinto.

 After a few pages into the book, I came to this second quote in p. 15. This quote trigger imaginations of fugitives hiding around the forests between Manaoag and San Jacinto.

>But till the middle of the nineteenth century, these forests were yet thick enough to afford hiding places for fugitives from the law, and to provide enough timber for the construction of ships needed by the Spanish Government.
