If a working environment is standardized, we spend less to no resources (time, attention, concentration, and willpower) on our structure and most if not all resources on the most important task: solving the problems we are working on. This is possible because [[A standardized workflow lessens the number of decisions]] performed in a working session.

Here are ways that we can standardize our workflow:

1. Use the same notebook for making quick notes ([[writing inbox]]).
2. Always extract main ideas from a source in the same format.
3. Always turn extracted ideas into the same format for [[evergreens]].

Standardization is practiced in note-writing systems such as [[zettelkasten]] and [[talahardin]]. Ironically, standardization also optimizes freedom ([[a good workflow optimizes freedom]]), and [[flexibility is the precondition to effortless work]].

# To do

- Literature note. Cultivate it to become a permanent note.
