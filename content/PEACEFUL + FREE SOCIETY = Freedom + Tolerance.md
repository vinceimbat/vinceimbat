I desire peace.

Peace can be achieved by destroying freedom.

But this isn’t truly peace. It is suppressed violence.

What I want is a world where individuals are both free and peacefully coexisting.

This is challenging because freedom means that people could choose whoever they want to be. This means that freedom creates a plural world, a heterogenous world. Freedom makes us different.

Peace can be difficult to achieve in a free society if and only if people don’t learn how to tolerate differences.

Our society is actually currently plural. And where there is peace is where people either are: a.) forced to obey one belief or b.) tolerating the differences of their neighbors.

PEACEFUL + FREE SOCIETY = Freedom + Tolerance

To have a peaceful and free society, we need to cultivate the habits of:

1. Respecting the freedom of others and cultivating our own freedoms
2. Developing tolerance to people who see the world differently
