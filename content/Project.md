Project is a set of [[thoughts/action]]s.

A project has one overarching intention, which requires multiple actions under it. Each of these actions have their individual intentions.

For example, a project could have the following intention: “I want to get married on 2022.” This project could have smaller intentions under it like “I want to find the best gown” or “I want to raise Php 100,000 for the wedding,” all of which are also projects by themselves.

This means that [[thoughts/life is a project]], with smaller projects within it.

If you have a single life purpose, then that is your life’s intention.

To satisfy that life purpose, you will have to do multiple projects, all of which have individual intentions. Each of these projects could require massive amounts of information.

A key difference between a project and an action is that while [[Individual actions use fewer knowlege]], [[Projects require more complex information than individual actions]].
