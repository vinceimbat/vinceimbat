## Jesa

influences
- Shoah, Lanzmann (1985)
- sublimity

how she organizes her work
- unifying concept
- understandability even by a layman

what is the traditional way of writing the essay?
- Retallack (2003)

To do
- Ask Jessa to send you her powerpoint

use essay when much is at stake but intelligibility is poor

## Gen

- vocabulary of the present
- ambivalence in the playfulness
- was able to destroy linearity and chronology and hierarchy
- simultaneity was highlighted
- novel: why can't it be ordinary and mundane like the Japanese? Filipinos have a burden to write about big events
- because she writes about the mundane, there is an expansion
- who are other witnesses? (did you witness what happened? - this is an ethical problem of the piece)
- "afterlives"
- focus on literature and art of reckoning: The Betrayed (Jessa's work falls here), The Remains by Daryll Delgado
- Neferti Tadiar, Remaindered Life: "waste value", life-making, pagbuburda kesa hurry
- insertion as assertion

## Allan

- sublime: divine na hindi mailarawan ng salita (panahon pa ni William Blake) = beauty
- Rancere's idea have ethics
- "unrepresentable" ang sublime, parang Dios na hindi marepresenta (limit, bawal)
- Rancere makes suggestions on how to traverse this trauma: provides ways on how to represent while not representing
- Is this transferrable to representing a flooded river? Is this problem = to the problem of Jewish Holocaust
- calamity as spectacle: matagal nang saturated ito

## Eli

- The Falling Man, the ethics
- truth-seeking but truth-perspecting (sino kukunan at paano? reflect on yourself as an artist and writer)
- ano ang teksto na dapat lumalabas sa panahon ng global grief?
- inanavigate pero hindi dapat makita

- Use fiction to approach difficult problems
- talk to people there
- focus on the everyday
- Mindanao book from Ateneo Press
- Riverrun
- Penguin SG

## Elio

- Can it really be cleaned?
- Pagbibigay ng kalinawan sa river
- Your body giving the river a body and voice

## Junley

- audience is limited to the poetic
- poetic of plurality: use many languages (as if a ripple); if I don't understand it, I will look for what it means
- mine your language some more
- no pan-Philippine idea as ending (great), just local
- literature reminds us

## Luna

- hinahanap ang encantatory voice
- River of Gold by Gina Marquez (p. 120)
- maraming literal na ilog pero marami ring figurative na ilog
- (p. 152)

## Vince

- layer 1 (above): social science and referential
- layer 2 (middle): images
- layer 3 (below): apostrophe
- persuasiveness and credibility of your lyrical voice in the lower gains credence from the upper part.
- there are archives, ethnographic material, news to draw from
- the lyrical part can be quieted by too much rhetorical questioning in layer 1; ask questions declaratively or in instructions (by implication)
- you tampered litery form (done)
- but conceptual framework is murky
- look for a new framework; can we not think on our own?
- i enjoy it but it isnt the intended effect because you are rendering a disaster. is beauty the intended effect? happy dilemma.
- Jose Saramago, Blindness
- Portrait of Artist as a Filipino
- ethics of rendering disasters vis a vis your intentions to work with experimental forms
- para kanino mo sinasalvage itong beauty?
- shudder of the sublime
- writers in the Philippines are drunk in contending with modernism and postmodernism
- contextualize your engagement with a thinker (Mallarme): bakit siya?

## Alvin

- be intentional with image-making
- river from pampang
- reflection on a murky river
- p. 142 and p. 143: image composition was gone (dapat traversals siya)
- madaling pagtagpi-tagpii dapat ang photos

think about destructions and detours

## Gen

Reparative reading
The Archipelagic Imagination
Fr. Allejo, translation of poems

terror and awe of disaster - Rilke

## Vince (me)

- the images and the form really stays in the memory
- the abstract promised a lot to me but I am not sure whether the essay fulfilled all those promises.
