Here are the following sub-areas under this area and their standards.

**Connecting - Lea**

I am consistently showing up to improve Lea’s overall life and our shared sense of fulfillment.

**Connecting - Friends**

I have articulated clearly to myself what kind of people I want to surround myself with. I have people in my life who are both like-minded and like-hearted to me. I consistently show up to these few friends who I invest on in a regular basis.

**Connecting - Pets**

I provide the best possible care I can gives to the little creatures in my life.

**Connecting - Family**

I perform my responsibilities as a family member and nurture the ties I have with my family.

**Connecting - Lea’s Family**

I have made my bond with Lea’s siblings, mother, titas, and other close family members stronger.

**Connecting - Neighbors**

I have maintained a peaceful, understanding, and loving relationship with my neighbors.

Connecting involves engaging with a [[Scenius]], which is composed of a [[Mentor]] and peers from a [[Community of practice]] ([[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]]).

I need to invest time and energy to establish long-lasting relationships in real life or online.

There are two main goals when connecting:

1. To find conversation partners who would help me sharpen my theories and my methods
2. To build an audience who would eventually support my work financially as patrons

To make this possible, I need to seek the following relationships:

1. Possible mentors
2. Possible peers
3. Possible fans

Fans will be my patrons, they would support me in adopting a [[thoughts/patronage model]], which is my choice of sustainability model ([[A patronage model is best for an independent researcher]]). Mentors and peers could be patrons too, but their main role is to sharpen my theories and methods.

To connect effectively, I follow a [[Strategy for Connecting]] (also see [[Slow connecting for introverts]]).
