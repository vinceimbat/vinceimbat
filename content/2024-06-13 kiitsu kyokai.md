During catch up, Celia said she needed to read my essays several times because they needed to be digested better. Meanwhile, Andrew mentioned that he shared one of my essays to the group that manages his church. He said he did so to let them know that it isn't just them that think about these things.

After a 20-minute seiza meditation, I lead the discussion the following:

***
From "My Free Religious Viewpoint" by Shinichiro Imaoka.

> ... people in existing religions who believe in free religion respect the freedom of people who have similar beliefs to their own. They would never insist on the absolute truth of their free religious position or reject other religious denominations.
> ... free religion does not regard the salvation of the individual differently than the salvation of society. It does not think that after individuals are first saved, then society will be saved by the joint efforts of these individuals. It believes that the salvation of the individual and the salvation of society will occur at the same time.

I grew up in a Christian evangelical household. In this tradition, we were encouraged to:

1. Point out what is wrong in the religious and spiritual beliefs of others (and to later demonstrate how our beliefs are correct and superior).
2. Point out what is wrong in the world in general (and to later demonstrate how our beliefs could correct it).

Our ministers found inspiration from Biblical accounts of prophets sent by God to show His people how they've lost their way and teach how they could redeem themselves. Jesus is often cited as the most important example of these prophets.

In hindsight, as someone who has left the evangelicals, I could say that evangelism has overdone criticizing how wrong other beliefs are to the point that the tradition has built a large wall between itself and others. It has become the very antithesis of interfaith.

Outside Christian evangelism, the practice of condemning what is wrong in other people's beliefs or in the world in general is also priced. Despite its many faults, the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines has a long tradition of activism and has participated alongside civil society in fighting dictators and social oppresion.

Now, in jiyu shukyo, I understand that:
- we honor the individual and the individual in the other (and the innate ability of that individual to direct their own spiritual life).
- we also encourage finding the unity in all religions.

But I wonder whether there is a place in jiyu shukyo for pointing out what is wrong in other people's perspectives or in the world in general? For example, jiyu shukyo encourages the nurturing of a universal cooperative society, which recognizes and honors the interconnectedness of individuals, society, and nature, an aspiration that goes against a lot of the values of contemporary economic life.

I, then ask, do we have a duty as explorers of jiyu shukyo to draw attention, either through speech or writing, to acts and practices that blatantly go against and threatens the freedom and well-being of individuals and the sacred interconnectedness of life and nature, even if doing so would lead us to criticize existing religious traditions? If we agree that we have this duty, is there a limit to it? How do we point out what is wrong about other beliefs or the world in general in a way that doesn't lead us straight to evangelism?

After my reading, Andrew asked whether there is anything that triggered the essay I just read. I mentioned that my recent trip to Clark, where I came face to face with the plight of the aetas in the midst of a New Clark City, may have triggered me. I also mentioned that I'm thinking about whether I should be critical of certain oppressive practices in my former religion (shunning), considering my tricky status of being categorized as an inactive member of the organization.

Andrew asked Celia to go first because he has a tendency to go on and on.

Celia shared a bit of her religious background. She said she used to be a devout Anglican, but her queries were unmet. She felt like a heretic. She then found the Quakers and stayed with them for 38 years. But she was unhappy with them. She found the Unitarians five years ago and it felt like coming home for her.

She mentioned a very interesting point. She said that our brains are sensitive to the negative, and this is why she kept on asking herself to what extent can she be in a group that thinks differently. She recognized that finding connection was hard, and that the shortcut, which is to settle with a community that thinks differently, does not work.

Andrew shared next. He introduced us to Raymond Guess and his book "What's a World Without Why?" One of the proposals of the book is that, instead of making absolute criticisms, one could make juxtapositions. Andrew gave the example of his upcoming blog post where he juxtaposed neoliberalism, a highly individual and liberal ideology that promotes a view of the self as superior to community, and a similar liberal conception of individualism from jiyu shukyo that is anchored in community. According to Guess, juxtaposition does not make a direct attack but remains critical through offering an invitation.

Andrew then introduces a German philosopher named Ernst Bloch and his book "The Principle of Hope." According to Andrew, Bloch was fascinated with utopias. Bloch offers a process of critiquing certain utopian beliefs that have proved damaging.
1. Look at a utopian belief that has been widespread yet damaging.
2. Answer why it remains attractive to many.
3. Look at its utopian core.
4. Recognize the good in the utopian core but offer an alternative on how it could be explained or realized better.

Andrew mentions his own illustration about people choosing to ride planes to visit places and escape their lives. While this is detrimental to climate change, we have to recognize the goodness that is in the desire to escape or visit places.

For Andrew, jiyu shukyo definitely should be critical. But its critique has to begin from a positive affirmation of the self's connection with the neighbor, society, and nature. The critique should not arise from a sense of protecting oneself from one's neighbor, society, or nature.

Andrew returns to Guess and mentions that often when we are critical we always ask people for solutions. But sometimes, it is sufficient to simply raise awareness of problems without offering solutions. There are times when we just have to tell people stop doing that.

But we should always be looking at creative ways to saw that something is wrong. Celia says that art is always hovering in possibility. She makes the interesting point that life imitates art and not the other way around.

Andrew said that it is very important to consider politics when we are talking about the subject.

Andrew also offered advice about my current situation with the JWs. He said that there is no single right thing to do, especially because I am taking into consideration my relationship with my family. I should also ask whether raising my criticisms would really change the JW system. If ever I still want to raise my criticism, I could do so anonymously with a group so I can still maintain my relationship with my family.

Celia and Andrew both provided upbuilding words by saying. Celia said that my example and demeanor by not fighting will have a message. I don't need a rigorous antagonism. I could be more cunning by being more and more myself. Andrew said I am the juxtaposition.

Around 10 minutes before 7 pm, I asked Andrew whether Imaoka was actively into social activism. Andrew said that Imaoka was heavily influenced by Tenko-san, who built a communal utopian community (Itto-en). Imaoka also supported unions. However, he never formally joined activist organizations. He was skeptical of them although he did show some courageous acts when campaigning against nationalist government after the war.

According to Andrew, Imaoka's social activism was characterized into two ways:
1. Creative ways outside formal groups and institutions. He affirmed the utopian beliefs from socialism and communism but creatively found ways of explaining and executing them.
2. His activism was mostly in the educative level (in the belief on free individuals who can free themselves via education)

Andrew mentions tai chi. Never go straight ahead. You let the energy of the opponent come to you and lead it to another direction. He mentions people in Russia bringing out wheelbarrows with their TVs in them as a performative protest against propaganda. It was funny and on point but doesn't break the law.

Andrew shared another link that further explains this last discussion: https://www.mdpi.com/2077-1444/9/5/151

# Raw notes

Raymond Guess
"What's a World Without Why?"
Rather than make absolute criticisms, you can make juxtapositions.

1. Individualism (js) - (neoliberalism)

invitation

It's ok that 

German philosopher: 
The Principle of Hope
Bloch

Utopias

He looks at something terrible but widespread.
But answer why it is attractive.
Look at something's utopian core.
Land at the utopian core and say it can be better explained here.

Climate

js has to be critical
but it starts with the positive affirmation
it is not about protecting yourself from the neighbor or society

R. Guess
- when one is critical, "what would you do?"
- we don't always need a solution to a problem
- we just have to raise the problem
- there are times when we just need to say "don't do that!"

Say that it is wrong in a creative way.

Art = always hovering possibility
Life imitates art (not the other way around).

Politics

Shunning
- There is no single right thing to do.
- The personal (relationship with family).
- Will criticisms change JW system?
- Criticism could be done anonymously (so they can still keep relationship with family).

Your example by not fighting as to your demeanor will have a message.
You don't need a rigorous antagonism.
Be more cunning by being more and more yourself.

You are the juxtaposition.

Writing and pictures.

Tenko-san

Imaoka was heavily influenced by Tenko-san.
- communism (small, not ideological)

Imaoka supported unions.
Never formally joined the social activists.

Imaoka became activist to push against the nationalism of the government.

Tried to change society moving away from institutions.

Affirming the utopian hope of socialism and communism but creatively do so.

activism = educative level (free individuals how they can free themselves)

creative = learning 

what doesn't break the law, funny, on point.
never go head on (tai chi)
- let the energy of the opponent come to you and lead it to another direction.
