We have outsourced [[thoughts/philosophy]] and a lot of this asking to people we think are more intelligent than usâ€”philosophers, spiritual leaders, and powerful people). However, it is unwise to do so because these questions determine all the other decisions we do in our life. There is a need to empower each of us to ask these questions. I, for example, personally need to build [[thoughts/my worldview]]. [[Philosophy has to be maginhawa to motivate everyone to think for themselves]].
