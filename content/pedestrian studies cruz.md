***
Most of the stanzas (1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11) are walking experiments. While reading them, I don't  see a collage. What I see are possible walks I could do. In a way they respond to Phil Smith's criticism of Rebecca Solnit's history of walking, that it is too focused on writing and not walking. Pedestrian Studies invites the reader to enact the poem and because of this it is more connected to the tradition of radical walking and the contemporary derive than walking pieces that focuses too much on the aesthetic of the writing.



Although Cruz provides the motivations for what she calls her attempts to make poetry ordinary and the motivations about how it happens, it isn't clear how it is produced.
