# Savoring subjective experiences over influencing people

Go and visit Nature regularly.

Continue intellectual journey.

Use the Renaissance Ideal as framework.

The point of my life is to savor my subjective experiences.

That's it for me.

Not much to influence people.

To change the world.

That is only secondary.

The subjective experience.

The whatever it is called within.

The awareness and its contents.

That is priority.

And the Renaissance Ideal makes it possible to focus on the subjective.
