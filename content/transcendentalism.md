An offshoot of [[unitarianism|unitarianism]] founded by [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

Here are the basic tenets of transcendentalism.
- A creator exists.
- This creator wants to be accessible to all his creatures.
- This creator made no special revelations to special groups and does not entrust the truth to any exclusive religion or philosophy.
- This creator has opened the channel of communication between himself and every soul.
- The soul is able to recognize and communicate with the creator.
- The soul can perceive its relationship to everything.
- Man needs solitude, reverence and faith to find this creator.
- Every man can be a mystic.
- Man can find the answers within himself. But also needs to observe nature to find answers there because nature contains patterns and principles.
- Once man has seen and discovered, he becomes a natural philosopher.
- Once he discovers the secret of the universe, he becomes a prophet or seer of the future.
- A prophet is a poet. His function is to speak.
- Every man can be a poet.

Per [[andrew j brown|Andrew J. Brown]], [[thoughts/james martineau|James Martineau's]] *Rationale of Religious Enquiry* had a profound influence to the development of transcendentalism. According to Brown, most contemporary unitarian ministers "see themselves primarily as descendants of this Transcendentalist movement." And since [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] has explicitly mentioned the influence Emerson had on him, it will also be an inspiration of his [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]].

This connection between transcendentalism and free religion makes sense why I have always been attracted to [[Henry David Thoreau]] and why my desired life work is a combination of [[philosophy]], [[contemplation]], [[writing]], [[walking]] (and other art forms like [[photography]]), and [[facilitating]].

>Ripley's positive review of Martineau's book had a profound influence upon the subsequent development of the Transcendentalist movement and it began to help it definitively to move away from a biblically derived Christian Unitarianism.
