Author of [[a pilgrim at tinker creek dillard|A Pilgrim at Tinker Creek]]. She writes lyrical essays and was told to be the heir to [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau]]. She revolutionized [[nature writing]] by democratizing it. One could write about nature without spending a fortune to travel in far places. How she used [[walking]] is also instructive, particularly with those who can't walk far.
