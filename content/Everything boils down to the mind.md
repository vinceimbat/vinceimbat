Focus is where thinking hinges, minding our attention well. And this is where almost all I do arises from: actions, words spoken, words written, images taken and shared.

The work I am doing is showing up and how I show up relies on how I show up within me first.

Try to focus on one subject at a time when thinking.
Write concise and simply.
Be intentional when taking photos.

Be mindful moment to moment.
