A [[life area]] can be subdivided into smaller sub-areas. The sub-areas function in unison. Their design is interdependent, so when tracking them, they should have individual folders, but these folders should be placed in a single folder. In Things 3 where there is no folder functionality, this can be done by putting a placeholder at the beginning of an areaâ€™s name, e.g., Sustenance - Resource Management.
