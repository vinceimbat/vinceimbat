The monthly report aims to present the general outlook of my past month in a single document. It presents a summary of my progress in three key areas:
1. Studies
2. Projects
3. Others

It also evaluates my major life areas: life system, physical health, mental health, relationships, sustenance, and life work.

The goal of monthly reports is to inform my goal-setting and planning for the next month and to become the main reference from which I will write [[annual reports]] and an [[annual review article]] during [[My annual review routine]].

I write it using the template: [[templates/monthly report]]. Here are the instructions on [[How to fill up the monthly report]].

Here are all the monthly reports I currently have:

- [[2020 Monthly reports]]
- [[2021 Monthly reports]]
- [[2022 Monthly reports]]
- [[2023 Monthly reports]]
