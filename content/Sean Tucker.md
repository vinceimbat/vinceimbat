Sean Tucker publishes his YouTube videos 1-2 times a month. He publishes more frequently on Instagram.

Things he said that I like:
- The people he looks up to and follows are people with great lives and have a vision that transcends the tools they use.
- The tools we use make us feel something and therefore they affect how e move in the world. This is why choosing the right tools is critical.
