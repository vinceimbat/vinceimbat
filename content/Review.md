A review in the context of a [[thoughts/life management system]] is any process that prompts me to look back at an [[thoughts/intention]] I set and the [[thoughts/action]] (or series of actions) I took to accomplish the intention. The purpose of looking back ([[Pay attention to what we pay attention to]]) is to know whether I am living a life of integrity, i.e, my actions produce end states that match my intentions ([[An action succeeded if its end state approximates its intention]]). Reviews allow a life management system to perform one of its most important function: to be at peace with our choices of action.

Life is super complex. [[How to build a life management system|My life management system]] needs to be simple to accomodate my mind's limitations. But it shouldn't be too simple. Complexity should be allowed. [[The frequency of reviews simplifies lifeâ€™s complexity]]. I cannot handle the entire complexity in one moment. But I can do so in different moments scattered across intervals. This is design. Design allows for an efficient life management system, where actions are managed and are in integrity with [[convergence tool]]s like [[thoughts/purpose]], [[Vision statement]], and [[Mission statement]].

Review systems must:

- happen at regular intervals,
- follow a checklist format,
- connect both actionable and reference systems.

I conduct four kinds of reviews

- [[Daily review]]
- [[Weekly review]]
- [[Monthly review]]
- [[Annual review]]

The key to regularly performing these reviews (except the daily review) is reminders, since it is difficult to establish habits that are not daily.
