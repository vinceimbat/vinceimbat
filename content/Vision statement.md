A vision statement is an articulation of one's vision.

Vision precedes [[thoughts/purpose]] and mission. It describes what you want to see happen.

I like to write a vision statement in the present tense and integrate how I want [[My life areas]] to look like once all their standards have been established and maintained.

Here is [[thoughts/my vision statement]].
