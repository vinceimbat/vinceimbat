After you write an [[evergreens]] ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]), add it to one or more outlines you have. When you [[combine curiosity with a note-writing system and practice]] daily, you will naturally notice the connections between notes, which will bear writing projects.

Create an outline by simply comparing two notes and asking which should come first.

Writing from bottom-up prevents you from making preconceived conclusions ([[writing using permanent notes encourages a scout mindset]]).

   When you write a new note, add it to one or more **outlines** you’re maintaining, creating a new one if necessary. Substantially-complete writing projects will naturally emerge.

   if we write new notes every day and notice how they relate to each other, these can accumulate into potential writing projects.

   Maintaining already-written notes in an outline is comparatively easy: just look at a pair of notes and ask: which comes first? (Pirsig)
