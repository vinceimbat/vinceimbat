Listening to someone talk about themselves can be transcendental. When we get deep into listening to someone, especially when that person is a skilled storyteller, we experience self-forgetfulness.

The same can be said with [[thoughts/writing]]. [[Writing is simply self-expression and communication]]. Writing is a conversation. We listen by reading and we talk by writing. Like any good conversation, we balance the two. But sometimes, it can be very pleasurable and transcendental just listening or reading. And somehow, by reading we naturally become better writers and by listening we become better conversation partners.

Story makes the world go round.
