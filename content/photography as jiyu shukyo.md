Photography: Andrew has explained this quite well. But for a larger practice, jiyu shukyo inspired photography should affect both choice of subjects and methods of doing it. Anything that moves away from fixixity will do.

What I couldn't do as a photographer is to capture the object in its entirety, completely. "There is no finality of vision."

What I can only do are:
1. Take photos of the object from as many angles as I could.
2. Recognize that some angles are better than others.

But there could be no conclusivity.

Movement is position-fulness.

The problem with political and social movements is that they are so hang up with the words with their theories that they dont question them. Once they achieve what they want they stay there and stop moving.
