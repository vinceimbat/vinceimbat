It doesn't have to be desperately fast. Just set your intention that you are letting go of achieving a patronage, and instead you will be more open into how you can use your interests and skills to give value to others.

I noticed this with my long walk to san pablo vs my jeep ride back home and my evening walks during the cancellation of inperson classes and my evening walks now that the classes have returned.
