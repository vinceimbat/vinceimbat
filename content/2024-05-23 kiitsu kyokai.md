Celia started the discussion by asking how different the devotion we are trying to create from the devotion he noticed from her religious friends, who were missionaries. I noted the she used the word "simple" to describe what her friends are doing, so I pointed out that I feel that while I am trying to live a devout life myself, I feel there are lots of potential to what I am building. The only problem I face is that there are almost no one around me who is doing something similar.

This is when Andrew shared that he wanted to have a prayer he could recite. He said he wants to adopt the [[komyo kigan tenko-san|Kōmyō Kigan]] or Prayer for Light, a prayer written by [[tenko-san|Tenko-san]] and used in his utopian community [[ittoen|Ittoen]]. Andrew believes the Kōmō Kigan will be what a [[jiyu shukyo]] prayer would be like. Andrew asks as what we think of it.

I shared my process. I told them that prayer is something I've also been thinking about lately. I shared that I grew up, as well as many people around me, in protestant denominations where prayers are not read or memorized but spoken freely. I told them that I miss talking to this persona but it is something I no longer do because I no longer believe in a personal God. I realized that before I can even pray again, I need to first define for myself this object of prayer.

The conversation then shifted to the problem of [[god|God]].

Andrew mentions [[baruch spinoza|Bruch Spinoza]] and his [[god or nature|"God or Nature"]]. According to Spinoza, Nature does what it does. Andrew says, the Light, which is the object of prayer of Kōmō Kigan could be interpreted as nature, since it isn't a persona.

Andrew then shares the two definitions of God, which he supports: one is [[wieman minimalist definition of god|Wieman's minimalist definition of God]] and the other is [[dewey concept of god|Dewey's concept of God]]. Andrew tends to favor Dewey more because he like to avoid treating God like a thing. 

Celia said Dewey's definition is the essence of incarnation. It is "timelessness hitting time" and the "formless hitting form." This, she said, is the only interpretation of the cross she likes. In my mind, I remember the interaction of matter and mind.

Andrew then presents the illustration by Thomas Neils. There are two drawings. The first drawing is a circle with a dot at the center. Andrew said the drawing represents the traditional view of the universe where in it is held up through this immovable center. The second drawing is again a circle with a dot at the center. But below the circle is a directional line to the right. The drawing represents the idea that it is the movement around the circle that creates the circle.

The lesson: everything is moving and changing. Nothing is truly stable. We are only "meta stable."

I asked Andrew whether he talks directly to this formless light rather than simply recite a written prayer. He shares the work of [[freya mathews|Freya Mathews']] [[panpsychism]] and said that we could because in someway Nature also converses with us. This prompted me to think whether I could use this to source out that rich Filipino tradition to improve liberal religion.

Andrew then share a bit more about Jodo Shinshu. He said that the main practice of Jodo Shinshu is to say "Thank God" when faced with events where one encounters "God." He also shares the image of the Buddha as symbolizing movement: Tatagata (The One Who Comes), emphasizing the concept of God as a moving relationship or event. He then mentions the "Theology of the Event" by John D. Caputo.
