Another great way to learn about your readers is to attend events they go to.

Here are some pointers to remember while in these events:
- Focus your attention on the attendees. Talk to them.
- Ask people why they came.
- Ask about what kind of work they love and why.
- Ask how they got into this field.
- Don’t try to impress people, and don’t try to sound too smart or savvy.
- Whatever you do, don’t promote your own work.
- Consider reaching out to those mid-level doers you identified. Ask simple questions that you need help with.
