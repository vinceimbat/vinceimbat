I want to focus on walking, photography, videography, designing and developing websites, podcasting, while practicing contemplation and mindfulness and discovering interests along the way.

I want to focus on the eternities.

I want to be near nature and beauty as much as possible and highlight them. I want to curate what I tell the world on just these things.

I want to document a life about these things and share that in my site and social media.

My most important core strengths are [[Appreciation of beauty and excellence]] and [[Renewed freshness of appreciation]]. Appreciation is where reverence becomes possible. My work is to appreciate life and the universe and help others appreciate it too.

What I don’t want:

- I don't want to engage in divisive topics.
- I don’t want to follow the news.
- I don't want to be very political.
