[[Every human being has a life management system]]. A component of a life system is [[Theory]]. The quality of a theory where one's life system is founded can be judged by objective and subjective criteria.

However, in my opinion, a good theory should ultimately help you to [[build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]] and, perhaps even more important, [[build a life management system that helps you be decisive]]. Remember, [[a life management system should free your mind]].

No matter how accurate and complex your theory is, if it doesnâ€™t help you achieve what you want to achieve, it is useless. [[thoughts/practice is the ultimate test of knowledge]].
