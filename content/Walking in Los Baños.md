When I walk in Cablong I feel like I am being stripped by their eyes. Everyone is looking. Lots of them are just spending the afternoon on the side of the road. I feel being stripped even if I am a man. A big man mind you. What more if I was a woman?

I need to be alone in the middle of rice fields to find the magic of my walks.

Back here in LB, I walk and almost no one recognizes me. The freedom of anonymity. I do not have to hide. I feel solitude in the middle of a hundred different heads.
