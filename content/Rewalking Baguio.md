Just a book idea that came to after watching the film [[Apostasy by Daniel Kokotajlo]].

I want to confront every single memory left in me about growing up as a Jehovah's Witness. I want to write them down. Perhaps even walk the places I used to walk at in Baguio City to relive those memories and write them down.

This is befriending my past, that important part of me that I have avoided for so long which I am now ready to confront to find reintegration and inspiration for the road ahead.
