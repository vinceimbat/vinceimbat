In [[Metalearning]], after you [[Identify concepts, facts, and procedures to understand the knowledge structure of a subject]], you have to anaylze them using the following process:

1. Underline the concepts, facts, and procedures that you are most unfamiliar with. These will be your major bottlenecks.
2. Look for the most effective resources to overcome these bottlenecks.
3. Avoid resources that won't help you with these bottlenecks.
