Usually our eyes see more than the only object the camera lens focuses on. The camera wants a single subject, the gaze wants to bring others into the fold. Mindful photography is a meditation of the nonhuman and our relationship with it.

An image is closer to how I see it if I use the viewfinder.

It's possible to see something but not see it.

1. Practice.
2. Bring an object from your walk to the workshop.

When things go together they are clutter. Individually they have a story. It is how we put them together that changes our relationship with them.

An image is created because of a pause.
- What becomes an image is that thing that you didn't see.
(FASCINATING!)

What is made possible when we put our awareness in nature?
