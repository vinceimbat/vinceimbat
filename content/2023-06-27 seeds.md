Place as mnemonic device.
Walking as spaced repetition.

Walking a worldview.

There's a cliche that home is not the place but the people. What I find is that this isn't universal. For people like me who trust people less than others, place is the one thing that is truly stable. I find that a particular weather, site, or smell is vital for my sense of home.

You have to understand that not everything is reducible to the nation-building project. While all of you are trying to build a nation, I am just humbly trying to build a life.

Walking under intermittent drizzles.
