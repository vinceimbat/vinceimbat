In my opinion, the [[Exchange economy]] (i.e., the non-gift world) should only exist in service of the [[Gift]]â€”that unpriceable thing we give to someone. The Gift is also what we give to ourselves and to others without expecting anything in return. Our intention for giving the Gift is ours alone. But if we know within us that our intentions are aligned with the Gift system, it fosters a different experience for everyone.

Right intention + Gift = Gift experience

Note: When I wrote this in my diary in 2019, I think I was alluding to the fact that some gifts by virtue of the intentions of their gift givers fail to be truly gifts.
