I saw something poetic today.
A spurting possibly broken artificial source of water. Every milliliter that rans out of it the university pays. And yet the tiny grasses, insects, worms underneath benefit.

Do we need to break this artificiality that we have created for things to return to where they came from?

Wonder is the water gate that opens to lead whatever flows flow into poetry, philosophy, photography, and all art form.

I am a writer who explores how walks can be platforms for writing lyrical philosophy.

I am excited by this concept of lyrical philo because it is really simple.

Use the microcosm to prompt thinking about the macrocosm. Use the local the specific, an object in your immediate environment to prompt thinking about the universal.

Noticing -> Photography -> Lyric -> Philosophy
