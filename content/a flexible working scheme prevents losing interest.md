A flexible working scheme allows us to change course as needed. It necessitates that we avoid making large predictions about where a project is going. In research, we need to [[use curiosity to guide your thinking]] and remember that [[writing that aims at insight must be organized in a flexible system]].

We do not lose interest in a flexible working scheme because we feel in control and [[Being able to change your mind means you are in control]]. It also makes working a lot fun.
