Sometimes it is not about being successful but about being happy for someone else's success that brings someone true fulfillment. (I wrote this in the early hours of morning after I woke up from a dream related to this moral.)

I'm 30 now. In 10 years I will be 40. When I'm 40, Papa will be 70 and Mama will be more than 60. My child might be around 5 years old at that time. If we are all lucky, my parents will both be around with good health.

Instead of an open journal, one thought piece with more quality photos. Biweekly is ideal. Drop the need to document your life.
