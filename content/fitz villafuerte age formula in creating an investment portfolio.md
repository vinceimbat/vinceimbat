Fitz can’t remember the exact source of his formula, but it follows the following steps:

1. Define how much your investment capital is.
2. Divide your age into two and treat the result as a percentage. Multiply that percentage to your investment capital, and invest that percentage to low-risk investments like government bonds, treasury bills, etc.
3. Invest half of your capital to moderate-risk investments such as mutual funds, blue-chip stocks, etc.
4. Whatever remains, invest in high-risk investments such as speculative stocks, forex, etc.

This formula is very similar to [[nassim taleb|Nassim Taleb]]'s [[barbell investing strategy]].

[[financial independence|Financial independence]] thinking debunks the last step because it intentionally goes for risk. My goal in investing is to protect my capital and to grow it so that I can sustain my cheap cost of living.

So perhaps, a better portfolio should consist of low risk investments and moderate risk investments diversified based in location (country and international) and asset class (see [[my ginger ale portfolio in etoro]]).
