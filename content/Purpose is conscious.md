Now one can say, "I do this for X but I can't clearly articulate X." That I think is fine, but intention cannot be unconscious. Whatever the unconscious reason motivating one to do something needs to have a different name. This is the reason we can't say that a crazy person "intentionally" hurt someone. He is not conscious of what he did. Intention is an element of action and action is always conscious. Intention or purpose is in fact the conscious element of action.
