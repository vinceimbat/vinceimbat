There are no objective definitions for words. All definitions are subjective by their nature. [[meaning is a mental construction|Meaning is a mental construction]]. [[words do not possess meaning by themselves|Words do not possess meaning by themselves]].

I can invent my own word. I can invent my own language. If that language becomes popular, we can create our own dictionary. But [[dictionary definitions are conventional]] of the words I invented. It makes communication easier. But [[consensual does not mean objective]].

Meaning attributed to objects other than words are also subjective. [[there is no objective meaning|There is no objective meaning]].
