_We now have, unlike original Christianity, a complete cast of bishops, deans, and pastors; educated clergy, degree and all, talented, gifted, humanly well-meaning. They all preach with tremendous confidence - doing it well, very well, stupendously well, tolerably well, or badly - but not one of them lives in character with the Christianity of the New Testament. This grand cast of characters accomplishes one thing: it gives rise to a false impression that because we have such a complete cast we must of course have Christianity, too._ (Kierkegaard’s Attack Upon “Christendom” 1854-1855, trans., with introduction, Walter Lowrie. Princeton University Press, 1944 pp. 29-35).
