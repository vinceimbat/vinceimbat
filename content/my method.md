I collect materials primarily through walking. My goal with walking are as follows:
1. To walk as much of the Philippines as I can.
2. To take photos and videos while walking.
3. To write about my walks.
4. To publish creative essays (text + photos) in a website that will become the most comprehensive collection of information on walking in the Philippines.
5. To send intimate newsletters to readers.
6. To create books out of the above creative artifacts.
7. To establish a sustenance model that helps me continue doing the above.
