## What have other studies already discovered about this problem or phenomenon?

Disability at work

people with disabilities (PwD) face different obstacles such as discrimination and unemployment (Konrad et al., 2013; Schur, 2003), which hinder their full inclusion in society, even in developed countries (United Nations [UN] Department of Economic and Social Affairs, 2018).



## How does this study relate to and extend this previous work?

Perspectives and accounts of inclusion from the point of view of PwD.

## To Do

- Look more into Lysaght et al., 2017.
- Refer to what you wrote in your proposed disability history framework: First-person accounts of inclusion
