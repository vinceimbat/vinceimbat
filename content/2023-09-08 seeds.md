Arrived at LB
Felt thrown
Started walking inside UP
>I went out for walks almost every day inside the University of the Philippines (UP) campus. It is where one can really start to feel the character of Mt. Makiling--trees start to get taller, bird songs become weirder, roads begin to ascend, and the wind starts to get colder.
Then I realized I wasn't taking the most advantage of my stay in LB.
- I looked at the map and identified points to visit
(Add a map of LB): caption - write points of interest in the lake
