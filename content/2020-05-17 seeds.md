Ground still wet. It will probably take two more days before it becomes dry.

Herons fly by a kite as if the children are controlling the birds.

The tobacco were already harvested. A few are being dried up. A man is carrying threaded leaves. I think he is setting them up on the sampayan. Were they wetted during the rain?

Why is the earth under grass the first to dry?

Frogs croak on my left.
Crickets chirp on my right.
