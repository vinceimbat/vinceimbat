Writing a weekly newsletter forces you to work with your notes, so it is a good practice to do so.

For Sunday

- How this influences how we approach spirituality
- How we approach writing

- Explanation of imaoka's concepts still a bit vague. Looking forward to reading his own writings soon.
- How do I witness your kitsu kyokai services?

Whilst I adhere to free religion, I don't think being a pastor is really for me. I am not close to the possibility. But I am currently so in love with writing that it is what's calling me strongest right now. The only difference now is that aside from a personal writing practice, I intend to write with others together. I see writing is a vehicle to fulfill my ministry as a serious writer and a writing teacher following the tradition of the writing process movement.
