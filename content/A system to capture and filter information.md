To organize my information consumption, I need to have trusted inboxes where I could capture possible resources to consume. Based on the media where information is delivered, I will be using the following inboxes:

- Articles - Instapaper
- Podcast - Huffduffer, Spotify (Listen Later - Podcasts)
- Music - Spotify (Listen Later - Music, Recently Added Albums)
- Books - Someday/Maybe - Books
- Films - Someday/Maybe - Films
- TV Series - Someday/Maybe - TV Series

The processing of these information will follow this diagram:

To limit the amount of information that enters this system, I [[Only consume information that is relevant to your purpose]]. Following this system allows me to emphasize [[thoughts/process over product]] in my workflow, which results to more peace of mind.
