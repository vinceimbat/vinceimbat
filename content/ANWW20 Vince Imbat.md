## Sir Vince

- malalim ang tinatangka
- different walks: cat walks, walking tourism, walking as art

The period tackled is long. Why did you choose the scenes and episodes included in the essay?
- showing vs telling: you were told not shown
- four oclock flowers (exposition) where time expanded

What is the temporal vantage point where you are telling the story?
- telling it from the present

Page 77, line 15-20.
- Believability
- Ngayon mo lang narealize yan?

Image text relations
- why are these the images used and why put them
- indexicality and referentiality

Form
- meandering structure
- it reads like an academic essay right now
- the theoretical part thickens but makes it very intellectual
- try problematique

Autoethnography is very focused on the self
- Gramsci "interegnum"
- it can be used to connect/traverse the socio-political
- if the personal has interegnum then perhaps even the social?

Audience
- ethical dimensions of publishing: are we ready to accept the implications?

Why is this essay urgent? Why are they
- Why include these elements
- Why tell it to people who might not need it.

## Sir Allan

Use techniques in fiction (point of view).
- Not a work about walking
- It was an essay about essays about waking.
- Bring us to the walk.
- Make it joyful.
- Use "streams of consciousness": play with the point of view. It doesn't have to be the I always talking.
- Totoong-totoo (ang totoo lang yung mga bulaklak); even photos not that true
- Fiction: setting, pagbubuo sa landscape
- Obligatory scenes: show the pastor inside the KH. Scene inside KH. Or describe how you go to the houses; scenes with sound bytes (dialogues: learn from dula)

## Maam Gen

- Narration, dialogue
- It is a griefwork
- Check: Teju Cole, A Month in Shina (Ishnamatar): one painting per day contemplate (?)

## Luna

- Physicalize your process
- Walking is male (Teodora Alonzo was walked but used to limit her gender)
- Urbana and Feliza (how women walk)
- Take advantage of your history with the deaf (emphasize); nonverbal ang paglalakad
- Jamie Abad: walking made her a great psychiatrist because she saw the death march (use sequences); not necessarily yourself (avoid navel gazing); use the others
- Lack of inspirational writing on questions of faith: honest, no pretention
- Bicycle and walking (dumadaan): nakikita mo people: the photos, the relics are lives

Walking studies are geared towards gender

## Ellie

- wag mong irevise
- walking can be used in anthropology
- method not an issue
- no problem definition of liminality
- liminality is vulnerable, implied but not felt, uncertainty lang ang obvious ++
- baka nga hindi kailangang tawaging liminality
- "portable identities" - while walking, throw it
- Identities that dont require rootedness
- there is no such things as individual (dividual) - manananggal culture; you are everywhere and anywhere
- "liminal walking"
- Self: the idea of teh Self is always relational (where are the others in that Self?)
- Wala ka man lang taong na-encounter?
- Ox and Cats
- ethnography is that ethnographic encounter (not the field): the text encountered is the text -> the encounter changed you as a researcher
- do not use the word auto; 
- beware of those debates and the traps: dahil alam mo yung genre, kaya mong lagpasan

## Hunny

- Declarative pronouncments of an abled body and cisgendered man. Owes it to the audience to explain.
- fatigue and heat are interwined
- walking in which climate? (consider)
- women can't walk for hours and even feel relax
- women can't walk in the night
- how about transpeople, and migrants, racial anxieties?
- walking in safe space
- "just give acknowledgement"
- connect the work
- how to do it? not sure.

* Walking is site specific (no side walks)

## Jessa

- arriving as a stranger to a familiar place
- palawaking ang meditation sa walking
- slow films: self
- Taiwanese new film directors
- Abas Kirostami
- sociocultural aspects of walking: time is a luxury for walking in the context where time is money; walking is an alternative way of living
- Jena Osman "Public Figures"
- When a Map of Folded Cities

## Alvin

- critical theory has become a philosophy
- we find critical theory not in philosophy (change religion)
- Marcel Proust "Remembrance of Things Past"
- Four Oclock flowers
- Rewalking baguio (favorite)
- this can be intro chapter
- next chapters zero in
- difficult comment because it is a healing thing
- "processual identity" (not need the old and self): portable nalang; no need to decide between the old and new (no need to be certain)

Allan
- old self and new self is residue of being a JW

## Junley

- Louisa's Cafe sa baguio (journalists and writers)
- legacy of Baguio to me
- Baguio is inspired by flaneur
- "Walking the Wound" poem ni Sir
- interogate legacy that Baguio left you
- find a publisher willing to publish this
- keep it as extensive footnotes
- maximize and optimize details
- methodology with discernment
- lexicon of walking in Pangasinan that could inform your method
- writing to discover a voice; it is performative
- this is where you'll find the self later
- write about the self in a way to extend to others, communal

## Joanna

- limen in her thesis
- walking is also in her thesis
- religious crisis also in her memoir
- it is a book project
- each comment is a chapter
- desire lines in architecture: walking desire lines
- you might not need the photos (misosen)
- 5 hours = 5 chapters
- walk itself as a structure
- place essay
- Narito: place essays of la salle
- remove the word autoethnography and it will stand by itself
- you are a creative writer ++
- your relationship with God: use it: most powerful material

## Martin

- walking is the subject of the research
- but walking 
- what is more exciting is the walks that havent happened yet
- mahirap yung pagbabalik sa tapos na
- this is just a background of the study for the walks that will take place
- walking as creating encounters (not looking back)
- theatre games
- even in forms that tend to be reflective, what other research methods can we appropriate
- the data will create the form
- Focus on future walks
- walk na may audio recorder
- if my encounter results to relationships ok na yan kahit wala nang product 

## Elio

- sad
- 


i feel like i walked with all of you.
biggest lesson: the walk although solitary shouldnt not be a self-centered endeavor
cite anecdote during the walk
I appreciate how you held my story.
you put me in limen but also strengthened my identity.
i will do my best to make justice to all the words you prepared for me.

stop might cry
