These are notes related to one specific [[project]] and are so stored in a single folder specific to that project. They don’t need to follow a single format like [[evergreens]]. In a way, they are like [[fleeting notes]], only that they are kept in a specific folder in the context of a [[goal]] ([[thoughts/connect a project with a goal]]).

After the project ends, these notes can either be deleted or processed into more useful permanent notes that can be used for future projects.
