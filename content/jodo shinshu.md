Brown]] also became a follower of this form of Buddhism, which seems to be simpler than the others. Unlike [[zen]], it doesn't require [[meditation]]. However, [[miki nakura|Miki Nakura]], my [[seiza]] teacher, practices seiza alongside Jōdo Shinshū and argued in one of his articles that this is alright and the two are complementary.
