[[Movement without purpose is not action]]. If you only think and articulate the purpose of your action after you did it (i.e., answering the question, "Why did you do what you did?" instead of "Why will you do what you will do?"), you are not articulating purpose but [[thoughts/meaning]]. You are interpreting a purposeless movement. [[Purpose separates action from non-action]].
