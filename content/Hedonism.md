Hedonism is the idea that pleasure is the ultimate good, the highest value in human life. Therefore, the things that produce the most happiness long-term and short-term are what are worth pursuing. This view implies that the components of life that are not pleasurable do not increase well-being.

Hedonism is refuted by [[Robert Nozick]] through the thought experiment of an [[Experience machine]].
