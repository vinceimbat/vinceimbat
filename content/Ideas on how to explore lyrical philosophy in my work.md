- Capture lyrical philosophy through journaling, Talahardin, reading, photographing, and walking.
- Follow peak experiences. Put yourself in a position where you could experience more of these. Then eternalize those experience through a poetry and philosophy, which will hopefully remind me of those moments and help others remember them.
- Strive to write at least one lyrical philosophical paragraph, where thought and emotion and beauty are together and where the experiencer "I" is part of it. If you can couple the piece with a photo, that'll be better.
- Do not force this process. If nothing comes out that day then nothing comes out. When it does, put it on the daily note for that day and collect it ala Henry Bugbee.

Success in navigating the geography of life relies on two forms of mastery:
1. Analytical
2. Emotional

Analytical is necessary to grapple with objective reality. Emotional is necessary to grapple with subjective reality.

Taken together, both knowledge propel us to take action (i.e., achieve finality).

Both are ways of relating with the geography. I must confess, I am naturally analytical. And yet I couldn't shake off the emotion and always feel like it is relevant even if I am not yet sure how to use it.

How to write lyrical philo?

- Achieve the state of mind you are in when doing poetry. But instead of a poem, write a line of thought.
- Trace the history of the thought.
- Express what u feel about the thought.
- Use the self.

Perhaps I should make the journal strictly lyrical except if there is a nonlyrical subject that wants to be written by hand on the journaling session.

Journal - free writing but priotitizes lyrical form (my feelings, my thoughts about, the history of my ideas)

Talahardin - free analytical

Lyrical philo - expressions of both truth and emotion. This is what I want to publish and share to the world.
