Here's a theory: As long as what you say you want to do is not a crystal clear hell yeah, all your intentions will remain tentative and you won't be able to keep habits, routines, commitments. Once you arrive at hell yeah, everything will make sense. Now the arriving happens only through trial and error. And so you just have to accept this phase. While in this phase, brand yourself purposefully as someone who is trying to figure things out.
