To know what to share, you must relate your story with what your readers need.

Here are a few things you can share:
- experiences (as connected to your creative work)
- conversations (as connected to your creative work)
- curiosities
- how you are developing your skills
- how you are relishing moments where you feel inspired
- how your work matters to you and how it can connect to what your reader cares about
- behind the scenes of how you do your work
- materials you use
- milestones
- educate them on the elements that makes incredible work
- what drives you on a deeper level
