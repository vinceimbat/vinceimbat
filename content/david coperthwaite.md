David Coperthwaite is an intellectual who lived a life in Nature, where he did most of his work in promoting yurt building. I found his book, *[[a handmade life coperthwaite|A Handmade Life]]*, via the References of [[thoughts/jacob lund fisker|Jacob Lund Fisker]]'s *[[early retirement extreme|Early Retirement Extreme]]*.
