This is an interesting definition of being humble—to forget oneself and serve others. If Lao Tzu is right then not being humble (or not serving others) will not stand. So, eventually, everyone of us will be serving others. This I think speaks to the inseparable nature of our interconnectedness with others. Our haughty disregard of the well-being of others in service of our own selfish desires is not sustainable, because eventually not thinking about other people's well-being will lead to our own peril: it will be a matter of life and death. What better way to cultivate this attitude of caring about others than developing a humble attitude of not-knowing. I become wise only because I admit that I've perceived nothing clearly—that I've not arrived. This admittance of not knowing makes me rely on others and makes me more mindful of their needs. I'm not yet this caring, humble, honest, and wise person, but it is the person I hope to become before anything is said and done.
