The best time to get [[Insurance]] is when you already have a stable source of income because of the premium you have to pay every year. Also, you already need to have an [[Emergency fund]] before getting insurance. Insurances become more expensive when you are older, so itâ€™s best to [[Get insurance while still young]].
