"[[thoughts/action]] is hope. At the end of each day, when you’ve done your work, you lie there and think, Well, I’ll be damned, I did this today. It doesn’t matter how good it is, or how bad—you did it. At the end of the week you’ll have a certain amount of accumulation. At the end of a year, you look back and say, I’ll be damned, it’s been a good year."

~ Ray Bradbury

## Note

This is a good quote to summarize daily, weekly, monthly, and annual reviews.
