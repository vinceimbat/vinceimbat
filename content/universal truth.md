Only I can talk about me truly.
- Then we can't communicate and have no shared human experience.
- Universality: There are things that are common, intuition.
- Intuition is not oppressive.
- Universal

There is a shared thing that we will never fully understand.
- Religious life = wager or gamble that we have something we share.

We are interdependent so we can communicate.

We are different.
But also the same.
We are One.
We are human.
Interdependence.
