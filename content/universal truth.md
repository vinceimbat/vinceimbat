Only I can talk about me truly.
- Then we can't communicate and have no shared human experience.
- Universality: There are things that are common, intuition.
- Intuition is not oppressive.
- Universal

There is a shared thing that we will never fully understand.
- Religious life = wager or gamble that we have something we share.

We are interdependent so we can communicate.

We are different.
But also the same.
We are One.
We are human.
Interdependence.

Interviewer: In a literal sense, you're writing for white people. Are you aware of that?

Baldwin: I'm writing for people, baby. I don't believe in white people. I don't believe in Black people either, for that matter. But I know the difference between being Black and white at this time.  It means that I cannot fool myself about some things that I could fool myself about, if I were white.
