Kaytagal-tagal ko nang
Niyayakap ang tula
Kailan kaya niya ako
Yayakapin?

I think I like changes, variety, newness. These are easily achieved through reading and the eyes and thinking.

My weeks could be monotonous without intention. What can I do to make each walk as adventhurous as each intellectual exploration?

What elements change the experience of walking?
- Gaze: looking down, looking up, looking around

In an ideal world, I would love to live my life every day like a poem.

Kapansanan

Nahihiya ako. At nahihiya ako na nahihiya ako.

The lesser the words the better moving forward. Deal with things internally. Edit first before going out.
