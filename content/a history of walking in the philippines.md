# Why do Filipinos walk today?

- Livelihood. Some Filipinos sell their goods while walking: street vendors (bottled water, cigarettes, candies), furniture sellers, broom sellers, food (taho, balut, puto, vegetables). Some skip from one bus to another to sell food for bus passengers.

# Useful highlights from Wanderlust

The history of walking is an unwritten, secret history whose fragments can be found in a thousand unemphatic passages in books, as well as in songs, streets, and almost everyoneâ€™s adventures. The bodily history of walking is that of bipedal evolution and human anatomy.

the subject of walking is, in some sense, about how we invest universal acts with particular meanings.

history of the imagination and the culture, of what kind of pleasure, freedom, and meaning are pursued at different times by different kinds of walks and walkers.

That imagination has both shaped and been shaped by the spaces it passes through on two feet.
