- [[psychogeography]]
- [[angkor photo workshops proposal]]

A car or even a bicycle makes one conform more to existing structures. Walking frees one up more.

Psychogeographic walking used as an aesthetic practice alongside urban photography have a strong Western history. I'm interested how these theories would stand when applied in a city in the developing world, such as Siem Reap. I'll be designing a series of multi-hour walks for several days while in the city taking photographs using psychogeographic techniques

openness
unanticipated encounters
materialities and rhythms of the city
spatial and temporal variations
new ways of looking at the city
exploring the aesthetic politics of cities

how urban space is used and by whom

What will be my leading question?

Method?
- psychogeographic po

Lolo takbo. Lolo takbo.
Broad cumulunimbus cloud
Soft sound of flowing water
A really dark cloud is covering the tip of makiling
Someone is playing with his flashlight
Sudden strong wind from the mountain
Rustling of leaves
