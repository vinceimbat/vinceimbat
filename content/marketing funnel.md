Funnel your reader into a five-step universal process.

1. Awareness - Let your reader know you exist.
2. Consideration - Help your reader consider you as a viable option.
3. Conversion - Help your reader choose you.
4. Loyalty - Nurture your reader's loyalty by giving them what they need.
5. Advocacy - Help your reader advocate your work.

The top—the widest part of the inverted pyramid—represents the broadest possible message to the largest group of people. Each step down the funnel slowly leads those who are most interested in what you have to offer to deeper levels of engagement with you and your work.
