“De Rerum Natura.” _Wikipedia_, 10 Apr. 2024. _Wikipedia_, [https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De_rerum_natura&oldid=1218250609](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=De_rerum_natura&oldid=1218250609).

the unhappiness and degradation of humans arose largely from the dread which they had of the power of the deities and terror of their wrath.

Epicurus thus made it his mission to remove these fears and thus establish tranquility in the minds of his readers.

Epicurus invoked the [atomism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomism "Atomism") of [Democritus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus "Democritus") to demonstrate that the material universe was formed not by a [Supreme Being](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God "God") but by the mixing of elemental particles which had existed from all eternity, governed by certain simple laws.

He argued that the deities (whose existence he did not deny) lived forever in the enjoyment of absolute peace—strangers to all the passions, desires and fears, which affect humans—and are totally indifferent to the world and its inhabitants, unmoved alike by their virtues and their crimes. This meant that humans had nothing to fear from them.
