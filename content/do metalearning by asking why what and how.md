You perform a [[metalearning]] project by asking three questions:

1. Why am I learning what I am learning?
2. What knowledge and abilities do I need to acquire?
3. How am I going to acquire the knowledge and abilities I need?

Answering these questions involve the following steps:
1. [[articulate your motivation to focus your learning]]
2. [[understand the knowledge structure of a subject]]
3. [[identify bottlenecks in your learning project]]
4. [[Apply benchmarking and emphasizing-excluding to know how to learn effectively]]
