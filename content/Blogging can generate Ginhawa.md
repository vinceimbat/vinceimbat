In [[My life plan]], one of the [[Five areas of my life work]] is [[Sharing]]. The primary vehicle I use for sharing is my blog and newsletter. It has to feel good while I'm doing it.

How can I do this?

One way is to talk about what I want to talk about:

- What is happening in my life
- What I am learning
- My application of what I am learning
- Results

To make blogging fun, I could gamify it:

- Talk about a problem
- Tell what needs to be done
- Do it
- Report

By documenting my journey, I create a repository of how I am changing my life. The number of projects recorded could be the XP points I accumulate.

Blogging also feels better when done with a community.
