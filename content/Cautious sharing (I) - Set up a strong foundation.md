The first part in the [[Cautious sharing process]] is to set up a strong foundation. To do that, do the following:

1. Start by writing a journal and conversing with yourself. Here, you can also [[Use a note-writing system]].
2. Share with one loved one who you trust and who always has your best interest in mind. For example, read your work to them.
3. Share with one friend, who you trust, ideally someone who is part of your ideal audience.
4. Share with a mentor if one is available.
5. Share with a group of friends or a small circle of loved ones, who you trust and makes you feel comfortable.

When you have build confidence and are more comfortable about sharing, explore [[Cautious sharing (II) - Share to the world]].
