One argument that supports this conclusion is our eventual non-existence. If we all are going to die anyway, nothing we do right now ultimately matters. Our entire life does not mean anything.

To save yourself from this meaninglessness, you can [[Find meaning in life by attaching yourself to something bigger than you]]. There has to be an entity (or entities) that hold a property that is ultimately meaningful (i.e., it is meaningful by itself, it is not an instrument to meaning).

However, only a [[god]] fits this description and [[God does not exist]]. In addition, [[Error theory]] suggests that [[There is no objective meaning]], which implies there is no absolute ultimate value.
