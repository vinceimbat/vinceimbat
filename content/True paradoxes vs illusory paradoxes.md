A true paradox is a logical contradiction. An easy to understand logical contradiction is a square circle. A square circle cannot be comprehended by the human mind. If you can comprehend a square circle then you're not human. Other examples are a married bachelor or a completed infinity.

The reason why true paradoxes cannot be comprehended by the mind is because they do not exist in the first place. [[True paradoxes don’t exist]].

In an intelligible world, true paradoxes cannot exist because they violate [[The three laws of logic]]. Remember, [[The laws of logic are universal and inescapable]] and [[Negating the three laws of logic is self-refuting]]. Someone who accepts logical contradictions can be described as "irrational"—a person who claims to believe what is beyond what the mind can do.

Illusory paradoxes seem like they're true paradoxes but they're really not, which means, by a little bit of thinking, we can actually intelligibly explain them. I see a lot of this in "spiritual" languages.

In Zen, there are a lot of paradoxical language. But they shouldn't be taken literally. They are there to remind someone to quiet their mind. It's impossible to even make sense of the koans. The koans are there to tell you stop thinking. If you believe the koans describe reality as it is, you are entertaining logical contradictions—a feat I don't know how your mind can do.
