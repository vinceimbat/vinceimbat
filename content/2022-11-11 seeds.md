- [[poems/ang maglakad mag-isa]]

May naamoy akong halimuyak. Tingin koy bulaklak. Ano kaya?

Matutunan mo sanang
maglakad mag-isa
sa lambak
sa lungos
sa pa-ilaya
dahil ang landas
matarik
malubha
at hindi parating
nandito sila.

Palalimin ang pag-iisip ni Rem. Philosophize the curriculum. Lapatan ng available sa literature. Lagyan ng kritisismo. Tapos i-expand pa ito.

Mas maganda if open access ang curriculum nang mapadali ang pagbuo ng interes sa bigger discussion from where Tungko arose.

Express to Tungko the idea of a minimum viable agreement. As people who are most familiar with Rem's work, I think it is safe for us to at least articulate the core. The use of this is that when we go to our designated groups, we can start somewhere or make the process easier. Minimum because we don't want to exhaust every single agreement possible and we want to give a chance for other members to air what they want. But we can't start completely from scratch (because some values are already existent, we just have to start putting it to paper). This minimum set of agreements will serve as an anchor during future convos. I repeat: we are not inventing new agreements. We are simply rememberig the unspoken agreements we already had when we joined tungko 1 and 2. We need to make it as minimalistic for now as possible.

Consult Undatu Bryan. We need to make it as minimalistic for now as possible.
