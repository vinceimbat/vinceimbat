This is the third among the [[Five areas of my life work]].

The purpose of sharing is to fully and authentically express mysef in a way that is both refreshing to me and to the person receiving my message, thus contributing to a culture of sharing.

# Why share

Why would anyone doing important and creative work share it? If the healthiest motivation for working is internal rewards, why pursue something that feels external? (See [[Why does one opt to live in public?]] for my thoughts on this).

# What to share

Because I also see my work as a form of [[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]], I would be sharing:

1. Theories - What I learned from studying and reflecting
2. Methods - What I learned from applying what I studied and reflected on

There are two ways I can share my theories and methods:

1. [[Sharing the product]]
2. [[Sharing the process]] (i.e. [[thoughts/work with the garage door up]])

My main art is still non-fiction prose writing. I want to write about my studies and the application of my studies in the context of my personal story and in a way that makes fine reading (see [[thoughts/i write personal essays]]). But I could perhaps also write plain direct philosophical artifacts and use them to write the more creative ones. For sure, I need to do a lot of thinking about my [[thoughts/writing]] and how I share it. Good thing I can learn from [[People who inspire my sharing]].

# How to share

Sharing is the larger context from which the motivation to learn different artistic media lies. I want to share my ideas, thoughts, and feelings better, so I learn writing, photography, and coding.
