Sino ako?
Find ourselves through writing.
Your story enters your creations unconsciously.
Write drunk, edit sober.
Tahanan (Froi's first poem in Tungko)
Identity (temporal sense, what you think you are) -> Essence
There is one story in the world. Recurring themes and stories.
A hero with a thousand faces. Many heroes, one journey.
Developmental stages.
Christopher Vogler brought Heroes Journey to film.
"Myths are the songs of the universe."

Mind = layas

Imitate, innovate, integrate

genre vs theme
- lesson, what you are saying, telling
- theme emerges by itself as intentionally write about it
- genre emerges after

A story is beginning, middle, and end but not necessarily in that order.
Fact vs story

3 act structure
"Suffering is the root of consciousness." - Dostoyevsky
Hidden Father by Kurosawa is where George Lucas got the idea
All archetypes are inside us.
Outer vs inner journey
Heal yourself or other or both

"I kind of worship at the altar of intention and obstacle." - Aaron Sorkin

Tao sa loob, tao sa labas
Use panlabas to develop panloob.
If binitawan na ang panlabas, anong matitira?

Research after writing. Huwag mong sakalin sa simula.
