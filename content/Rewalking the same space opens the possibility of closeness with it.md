Rewalking may not have the same magic that the first walk, the explorative walk, has. But it elevates the walk into a search, and the search can become a practice. Both the search and the practice transforms the walk into a looking closer, a building of a relationship that was once not there. The consequent walks become surveys of what has changed. Rewalking is how a walker sucks the nectar out of everything, as [[thoughts/henry david thoreau]] would say. Every day is a new walk and the same path is always a new one by virtue of the changed in the exterior physical world ([[Wilderness of geographic space]]) and the interior mental world ([[Wilderness of the mind]]).
