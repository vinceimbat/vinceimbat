Change one person's life now by crafting a meaningful experience.

When writing an article, creating a podcast, or creating a social media strategy always remember that you are creating an experience.

Make conversations and connections with individuals part of your work. Create experiences and don't hide behind the safety of content.

Ask yourself: What experiences can you create around your gateway? How you can give back to specific people in a huge way?

When creating an experience, be ludicrously kind and generous, especially to those who support your creative work or creative work like yours. Invest way more than you think you should.
