Walking around UPLB at this time of the year is like walking around it in the middle of the pandemic. Those were hard times but it had lots of great walks.

How about UPLB + Makiling Botanics in one walk?

Do a lot of work. The work is to really get to know the place better. The book is just a pared down version of all that work. It is not the most important part of the work.

Write an essay about walking in the night.

And yet again, I realize that the most optimal essay writing schedule for me is biweekly. It has the regularity and challenge of producing more writing. But it does not compromise quality and forces me to produce. It allows for editing. I know this already. I just resisted.
