Creative Research as Practice (2017) by RL Skains
Writing about writing
Define "body of work"
Autoethnomethodology
Less identity (not monolothic)
x identity -> âˆš subjectivity (that evolves through time)
"passing"
Throw it to the River by Nice Rodriguez

Why do we hide ourselves?
To write a certain way
- systemic
- to be published, to win, to advance in one's career

hyphen in pagka-lesbiana as disruption

Nicole Brossard, Picture theory

Origami essay
What can the form do to escape conventions?

Check her Palanca essay.

The essay can do all of it: poetry, short story, etc.
"hermit crab" essay?
- Playing dress-up (when you remove essay, the original form is still there)
- Direction for my Care
- Danger: Short story in the form of affidavit

Find your own way
We When by Jacader Zolita

Daring kasi not part of lit system

Identity is in the resistance to boundaries that forces you to not be who you are.

Love
Live
Write

What makes us stronger? Is there a way to do it without being hurt?

Identity as project of becoming not being
- process is culture

Saan nakikita ang ipinagbabawal na pleasure?

Non-standard bodies and pleasures
Non-standard body, pleasure, and writing

bell hooks - maintain marginality because that is where my strength resides
(power could be in invisibility if there are negotiations happening)

Resistance to boundaries, always a struggle?

Tibok
Woman to Woman by Aida Santos and Geane Villar
