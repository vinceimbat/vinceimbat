Pagkaliko ko sa Narra, napansin ko ang nagkandahulog na mga prutas na mala-sineguelas. Galing sila sa pagkatayog-tayog na mga puno na nakalinya sa dulo ng library grounds. Ano ang mga punong ito? Napakarami kong hindi pa kilala sa kalikasan.

Bakit ba ako akit na akit sa paglalakad? Sa paghahanap nitong pakiramdam na hindi madaling maipaliwanag? Sa katahimikan at kapayapaan. At bakit ba bagaman akit na akit ako, parang nag-aalinlangan pa akong lumalim? Nakakulong pa rin ba ako rito sa paniniwalang wala sa pag-aaral ng kalikasan ang sagot sa kung paano ba mabuhay? Naniniwala pa rin ba ako na ang sagot ay nasa mga libro lamang?

While walking up forestry, I came across two dogs walking down. I remember seeing a lump of meat one time when I was going up forestry. From afar it looked like a log albeit a weird looking one. Upon closer inspection, I saw that it was a body of a dead dog hardened by the cold. Its stomach bulged and its hind legs were apart like branches of a dead log. As I remember this, I waited for a lone car going down Lantican to pass the first dog I saw. Made sure it was ok. A few months ago, two cats of UPLB died from separate car crashes. These happened about an hour apart. I notice that drivers here drive faster when there are more people or animals on the road or when the roads are narrower. They go against nature. Perhaps this is why I can't make myself buy a car no matter what I do. I prefer walking.

## Walking to Forestry on a Caffeinated Mind

I took a tablespoon filled with coffee and mixed it on hot water an hour before I walked. And now that I am walking to forestry I could hear everything, see everything, feel everything. I raise my head up at the sky and see the clouds dissolving into the night like coffee granules on hot water.

Maladayaming tuyong damo sa gilid ng daan
Araw-araw paulit-ulit na paglalakad
