Functional definitions of religion determine inclusion into the category based on the role a member plays in a human's life. Emile Durheim's (1912) definition that religion is a system of practices that unite people into a moral community regardless of whether they believe in unusual realities. Similarly, Paul Tillich's (1957) definition of religion as a dominant concern that organizes an individual's values is functional. Using a functional definition leads one to conclude that ideologies like capitalism, nationalism, and Marxism are religions, and that celebrities can achieve religious status. On the other hand, using a functional approach can also lead one to interpret formerly religious objects and practies as irreligious.

> In the twentieth century, however, one sees the emergence of an importantly different approach: a definition that drops the substantive element and instead defines the concept religion in terms of a distinctive role that a form of life can play in one’s life—that is, a “functional” definition.

> One sees a functional approach in Emile Durkheim (1912), who defines religion as whatever system of practices unite a number of people into a single moral community (whether or not those practices involve belief in any unusual realities). Durkheim’s definition turns on the social function of creating solidarity. One also sees a functional approach in Paul Tillich (1957), who defines religion as whatever dominant concern serves to organize a person’s values (whether or not that concern involve belief in any unusual realities). Tillich’s definition turns on the axiological function of providing orientation for a person’s life.
