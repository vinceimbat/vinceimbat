My creative life is an extension of my life. The main reason why I create is because I want to understand the world and live well. My life is my most important artwork. Therefore, my creative life begins within. I'm my first audience. Whatever creative work I do in private is my most important work. I believe that creation is first an act of renewal. This inner work is the most fundamental part of creative life. I could do away with all the others but not this.

This is why the most important parts of [[my daily routine]] are those that involve [[meditation]], [[contemplation]], [[walking]], and [[journaling is sacred|journaling]]. When I'm busy with sustenance work, I could let go of other projects except these.

(Note: Connect here discussion in [[understanding and living are the core of my life work]])
