The allocation of benefits and burdens by the economy is not a result of deliberate allocation to specific people. The economy emerged from nature as an [[Spontaneous order]] and [[A spontaneous order has no personal intention]]. Since [[No personal intention in a spontaneous order means no justice or injustice]], the economy can neither be just or unjust.
