A swarm of little birds made me stopped on the trail. I still don't know what they are. Are they maya due to their number? There's a lot of them despite their tiny size.

A calf approached me. Older than the brown-hatted calf. He rubbed his head on a mound and started bellowing. He did this for more than a minute.

I left him and continued walking. Spotted a few herons on the right field. As they saw me approached they flew together, four of them, separate at first then converging. They flew NorthWest. Two more followed them. Are they going home? Where do they sleep at night?

At both horizons, rain clouds are forming. We might have rain later.
