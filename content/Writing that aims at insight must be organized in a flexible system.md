[[thinking must produce insight]]. And [[insight cannot be predetermined]]. They usually arrive as vague ideas become clearer. The path from vague ideas to insight is non-linear ([[Writing is a non-linear process]]). Only a flexible system unbounded by planning is the natural container to capture insights ([[Flexibility requires an equally flexible work structure]]). This is because [[planning is unsuitable for thinking]].

A flexible writing system should allow you to [[use curiosity to guide your thinking]] and shift your attention to follow leads without destroying the bigger structure and trajectory of a project. This is the only way to be open to insights. And again, this is related to the subject of autonomy because [[a good workflow optimizes freedom]].

- The system should also encourage the immediate capture and nurturing of insight. Insight sometimes comes after repeated practice or returning to the same problem repeatedly. I discovered from doing [[my annual review routine]] that I have refined my answer to a question or problem in between several months, something I won't see if I don't make an annual review. Therefore, the [[life management system]], specifically [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]] should encourage easy capture and continuous review to help me think and feel better and, therefore, live better.
