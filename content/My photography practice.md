I want the photos I take to reflect the core of my life work ([[understanding and living are the core of my life work]]). I need them to be philosophical. How can I do this? Perhaps less words in their captions. They have to be short but philosophical.

# To do

- Integrate [[contemplative photography]] and think about how can you develop a practice more.
- It might also be useful to see (or ask) how [[Andrew J Brown]] is approaching this.
