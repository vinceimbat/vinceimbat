Assuming that I have chosen a good book, I apply [[my studying process]] to produce two kinds of artifacts:
1. [[evergreens]]
2. Product-oriented notes like [[structure notes]], [[outline notes]], or [[draft|drafts]].

To arrive at these artifacts, follow the following steps:
1. Read the text while highlighting anything that is useful. Be very selective with your highlights.
2. Extract your highlights and put these in a note in [[zotero|Zotero]].
3. Create a new note and process your highlights into [[literature notes]].
4. Convert literature notes to permanent notes ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]).
5. Use permanent notes to write structure notes, outline notes, and drafts.
