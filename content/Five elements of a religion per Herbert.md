Edward Herbert (1583–1648) proposed five elements that constitute a minimal definition of religion. These elements, which he called "Common Notions," are:
1. A belief in a supreme deity
2. A belief that the supreme deity must be worshipped
3. A belief that the cultivation of virtue is the most significant element of religious practice
4. A belief that one must seek repentance for wrong-doing
5. A belief that one is punished or rewarded in this life or the afterlife
