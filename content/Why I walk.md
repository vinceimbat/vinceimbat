Living is living. The mundane. What I was hoping to get from my walks is thus connection with the mundane and yet also meaning-making (to elevate what I saw and transform it beyond mere survival). I create that meaning through writing. First narrating the walk, highlighting sources that I could then interpret. And then interpreting those resources.

I also create meaning through photography. Here it is less clear. It is difficult to be intentional with the images I capture while separating fact from meaning. All my photographs moving forward that I want to share shall have meaning. Shall be meaningful. Or perhaps I should just let myself free and try to flow. But at the same time always strengthen my philosophical tendencies so that it tranports into how I see things.

Philosophy -> Walking -> Photos + Narratives

It is always philosophy first. The thinking. The meaning-making.

- Leaving: leaving the church (on a bike, protesting by not attending the memorial)
- Reconnecting with the past: years later, I walked in Baguio remembering the many walks I did there as a preacher. And realizing I can still do this. Can still walk and remember what I did before.
- Searching: 10 years since I left the church and I still feel like I am looking for something: community, purpose, belief. That search has felt a lot like it isn't moving. Establishing new friendships is hard. Trying out new ideas is hard. There is a feeling of always starting out from zero. When I walk, I always feel like I am moving. I am still searching but I am not doing it too hard and it always feels like I am making progress.
- Insight and rigorous intellectual exercise: I think deep when walking.
- Surprise
- Cultural, historical, and societal familiarization
- Being good
- Being healthy
- Mindfulness

# Other reasons

Being in nature not only makes me feel better but also reminds me of what man is when bare of all the things he is nowâ€”of what is truly important. Perhaps I want to reflect on specific philosophical questions, but I answer them through reflection on nature, our place, our personal narratives, history, and culture.
