# Summary

In May, I was able to dedicate more time to exploring [[jiyu shukyo]]. First, I tried instituting a walking [[kiitsu kyokai]] practice with Lea, which I wrote about in my newsletter article [[a sunday walk|A Sunday Walk]]. We've kept the practice for the entire month, and I've also shared it in Facebook where many resonated. Second, I also started weekly Zoom calls with Uwa, the first time I did a one-on-one spiritual session with someone outside a church. These two experiences helped me gain first-hand experience on what it looks like to have a ministry in my current context. Third, I deepened my relationship with [[miki nakura|Miki Nakura]] and fellow seiza practitioners after being given the privilege to talk about my spiritual past. Fourth, I've started translating [[imaoka principles of living|Imaoka's Principles of Living]] into Filipino: [[imaoka mga simulain ko sa pamumuhay|Mga Simulain Ko Sa Pamumuhay]]. Fifth, Andrew helped me understand what [[universal truth]] means. But perhaps the most important advancement I did this month was arriving at the decision to engage with the problem of God. Of course, Andrew was my primary guide. He introduced several alternative ideas to the prevailing God as a persona dictum. He introduced [[baruch spinoza|Bruch Spinoza]] and his [[god or nature|"God or Nature"]] idea. He also introduced [[wieman minimalist definition of god|Wieman's minimalist definition of God]] and [[dewey concept of god|Dewey's concept of God]]. Of course, there is also the radical postmodern idea of God as an event by [[john caputo|John D. Caputo]]. To deepen my grasp of [[nontheism]], I also read the introduction of [[divine hiddenness and human reason schellenberg|Divine Hiddenness and Human Reason]]. I wrote about my desire to deepen my understanding of God in [[bathala wala intro|Bathala Wala]]. In other news, I wrote another newsletter ([[never finished never arrived|Never Finished, Never Arrived]]) and I got accepted into PRS17.
