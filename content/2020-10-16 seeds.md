AM

11:50 AM

Sky reading

- Medium-sized low cumulus clouds in southwest.
- Medium-sized Cumulonimbus clouds overhead.
- More stratus clouds on the east but some low and altocumulus too.
- In the north or low cumulus clouds but not yet dark.
- Windy but not as windy as before.
- The clouds block sunlight so it isn't too warm at this time.

PM

It rained before I left for fieldwork. But the rain was light and the ground is not as wet.

I brought Mama’s phone with me and when I took it out of my bag I thought I didn’t bring my phone. I only learned that my phone was there too when I got home to return Mama’s phone and instead of giving her her phone, I was actually giving her my phone which was inside the bag after all. What a hassle! But I was able to practice stoic challenge and still enjoyed my fieldwork.

The Cordillera is in full disclosure.

I wonder how geologists classify or categorize the different parts of a mountain range.

From where I am standing, there seems to be five mountains in the Cordi range.

The peaks will be a lot but as I count them probably more or less 20.

Four herons freely moving about this field in front of me. One black dog behind them roaming.

Sky reading

- Low medium cumulus clouds scattered in the north with altostratus and altocumulus behind them.
- Same on the east but stratus are more prominent. Cumulus larger. The Cordillera is blue but not hiding much of itself
- South is filled with low cumulus. I think that is what brought quick and light rain this morning or early afternoon. It is probably raining at Villasis and Urdaneta now. Above the large low cumulus are altostratus clouds.
- The west has more altostratus. Just a long low stretch of stratocumulus.

These green palay are so pleasing and relaxing to the eye.

Two needle dragonflies playing. One bit the other’s tail. I was there about one feet away from them squatting and they didn’t get startled by me until I tried to hold one’s tail. Then they flew away.

That small bird doesn't look like a sparrow. It is an entirely different bird. I saw it up close. It is darker in color, smaller, and more agile. It’s probably the pacific swallow

Two men walking with two sacks. Where are they bringing it?

These birds look like they're walking on water.

Owl is out and roaming the field facing North.

The reason why we need nature writing is because there is one nature but multiple experiences of it. When you write your experience of the landscape, you create your own landscape.

I saw it. The owl found a prey. A mouse. It hovered down and maybe gone for more than 5 mins. It was eating. Then it moved it's prey to a different location nearby. It is still feasting. That meal is probably its first and will be enough for now. Owls help regulate the population of mice in the fields, which extend to mice inside our houses. I wish we have more owls but we only have one. Dondon said, the owl’s partner was killed.

Found this plant. Nature ID says it is probably ground ivy (Glechoma hederacea). But to confirm, I need to cut it and smell if it has a minty smell and hairy outer surface.. If not, it is possible that it is the common mallow (Malva neglecta).
