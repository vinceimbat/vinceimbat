Direct primary research means you can put names and faces to your readers because you have engaged with them directly.

This could involve developing colleagues, who are people doing similar work in your field and who can connect your work to an existing audience.

While talking directly with your audience, probe:
- what your ideal audience cares about,
- where they hang out online and in person,
- what other creative work they love and why, and
- who they admire and listen to.

Design each reader outreach as a meaningful event, where you learn something new about your audience when you do it and it fuels a deep sense of momentum.
