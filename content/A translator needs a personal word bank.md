A translator needs to have a wide bank of vocabulary. Since remembering isnâ€™t always easy (in fact, the brain is so poor at it), a dictionary and a thesaurus work wonders. But still, a translator needs to know when a specific word is being used in the language or whether it is still being used. This knowledge is nuanced and can only be gained from a long experience of using the language.
