Walking allows us to feel different states of being. It allows us to feel pleasure, which one experiences when encounering a body or substance. It triggers joy, a feeling linked to an activity. Unlike pleasure that decreases with repitition, joy increases with repetition. Joy when walking happens when you realize that your body is made for this activity and also when you realize you are alive. Walking also increases the opportunity for happiness when it comes. Lastly, through the alernation of rest an movement, it is possible for us to feel serenity, a state of letting go and not being trapped by fear and hope.
