"as researchers, creative writers, intellectuals, artists, we do not only produce artifacts. For better _and_ for worse, we produce and reproduce social relations and forms of life.

When we tell our stories and receive the stories of others, whatever we do with them--whether we honor or ignore them, understand or misinterpret or erase them--we are building collective spaces. We _do_ and undo ways of being with ourselves, with others, with the natural world, with our social and institutional contexts."

~ Jean Emily Tan
