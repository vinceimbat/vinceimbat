My mission is to [[living|live]] my life deliberately by continuously acting according to my [[intention|intentions]]. I want my intentions and [[action|actions]] to be informed by my [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]]—a free, creative, and inquiring [[spirituality]], founded on a deep and honest [[understanding|understanding]] of reality: myself, others, and the universe.

Every day, I try to "suck all the marrow out of life" through a pursuit of [[thoughts/beauty|beauty]], [[meaning|meaning]], and [[wisdom|wisdom]]. I maintain several daily practices that help me do so. [[seiza|Seiza meditation]] and [[walking]] help me directly interact with the universe, while mindful [[reading]], [[journaling]], and [[my studying process|studying]] through my [[talahardin]] help me learn from existing archetypes of the life I want to live.

I strengthen my personal practices by joining and facilitating meditation and conversation with others: my partner, friends, and the [[kiitsu kyokai|kiitsū kyōkai]] community I'm a part of. Mindful that my actions always affect others, I practice [[compassion]] and strive to deepen my connection with fellow humans and other sentient beings.

I further express my jiyū shūkyō, as well as share what I learn from my personal and community practices, through [[photography]] and [[poetry]]. My goal is to combine all of these into beautiful [[essay|essays]] that I publish in my website and [[newsletter|newsletters]] and books that inspire others to also live deliberately and pursue a similar free, creative, and inquiring spirituality.

To support myself in this mission, I take care of my mind and body so that I'm always at my best state. I have also mastered my relationship with the material world. I support myself through meaningful work, use resources efficiently, and limit my interaction with the exchange economy by developing [[self-reliance|self-reliance]].
