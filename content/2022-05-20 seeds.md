Walked at Do√±a Aurora.

For some reason, I feel really good today. Was it the vitamin C? Was it the sleep? My mind and body is thanking me for whatever it is that I did yesterday to bring me in this situation. My goal is to feel this way most days of my life, so I can do what I do best and maximize happiness and meaning in my life.

Pursuing a healthy life has been even more motivational since this is connected with me being frugal and spending more time to what I want to do. It is all interconnected.

Next month, I shall be more intentional in establishing better habits and behavior changes.
