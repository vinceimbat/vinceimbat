Since [[walking accomplishes multiple goals]], I take daily walks to make progress in several areas of interests. However, my most important goal when walking is to attempt to be in a poetic state of mind, to be in the zone, and from there make myself more open for [[lyrical philosophy]]. To do this, I follow [[my thinking while walking strategy]].

After feeling satisfied with my philosophical walking, I then switch to walking for fitness and getting my 10,000 steps for the day.
