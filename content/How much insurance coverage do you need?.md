Jacob Lund Fisker only paid $91/month (P4,368).

Ready2Adult pays P2,683.5/month for an FWD insurance

It has to be 5 to 10x your annual income: P 3Mâ€“6M.

You don't have to use a single life insurance to achieve this goal. You can slowly build towards it.

Your annual premium shouldn't be more than 10% of your annual income: P60,000 or less. P5,000 per month.
