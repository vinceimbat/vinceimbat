I understand that walking is a privilege for those with time, healthy, and limbs to do it. In the evenings, at least in my country, walking as a male is less dangerous than as a female.

But walking is part of a wider spectrum of movement, i. e., being in our bodies, which is necessary to be truly alive and go against the stasis created by a world so inclined in keeping us seated behind bright screens and thinking for as long we can be baited into doing so.

Entering this part of Makiling now. Dark. No lights. The red backlight of a car shines nearby. Insects chirp rhythmically. The wind gets colder.
