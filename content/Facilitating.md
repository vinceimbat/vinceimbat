This is the fourth among the [[Five areas of my life work]].

I use facilitating instead of teaching because I don’t want to be a teacher. A [[Facilitator]]:

- Helps individuals listen to themselves, that is, uncover their innate knowledge.
- Is on stand by. Individuals approach him/her if they need help.

It is important, therefore, that a facilitator’s methods are as neutral as possible. [[Being neutral is the only way one can avoid being prescriptive]].

Eventually, I would like to explore how my methods and systems can be applied to other individuals or individual-centered small groups (like those in retreats). I feel like one of the best ways to experiment my methods and systems could be a [[Self-directed learning center]].

Societal application of my methods and systems will be tricky. But I can explore these theoretically. For example, I would like to explore how we can facilitate amoralism and anarchic principles in a broader context.

As listed in [[thoughts/living]], I can facilitate the application of methods and systems relating to the following:

- Learning through [[Self-directed learning]]
- Designing a ground-level productivity system
- Reconnecting with one’s [[thoughts/true self]]
- Designing a system that aligns one’s actions with one’s true self
- Building a [[Personal knowledge management]] system
- Using systems and methods to accomplish basic well-being goals
- Creating a personal philosophy of living
- Creating a life manual
