- Longer seiza (30 mins.)
- Journaling anchored to:
	- Self-status
	- Connection with others
	- Connection with nature
- Carefully curated reading list
- Radical walks
	- Close observation
	- This necessitates strengthening my theory on walking.

But these are all inner work. What will my outer work look like?
