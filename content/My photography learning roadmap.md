## Learning objectives

**Main objective:** My most important objective is to use photography to amplify my philosophical and writing practices.

**Sub-objectives**

1. To identify and buy a professional camera that I can grow with in the years to come.
2. To master how to use that camera to compose and capture photos.
3. To find my photographic voice and establish a vision (i.e., philosophical photography that complements what I want to do in my writing and life work).
4. To master how to channel that photographic voice and vision into effective and beautiful compositions.
5. To acquire a mastery of editing that is appropriate to my voice and vision.
6. To establish a workflow for developing my edited photos and sharing them on Instagram.
7. To establish a photo management system that supports my creative work.

Is this project instrumental or instrinsic? Intrinsic.

Learning time: Approx. 3-4 months (120 days)

Metalearning time: Approx. 12 days

	- **[Canon EF 135mm f/2L lens](https://jamesclear.com/link/canon-135mm-lens)** - Fixed zoom lens
