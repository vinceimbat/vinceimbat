[[I am a hodgepodge of people who inspire me]].

The works of these people influence how I perform the [[Five areas of my life work]].

I canâ€™t necessarily call each of these people a [[Mentor]] since I haven't established that relationship with them yet. Also, [[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]] would rule out most of them since they're not necessarily working in the same field that I do ([[My field is practical philosophy]] or [[A life in letters]]?), which might actually be beneficial because [[Do I really need a field?]]

- [[People who inspire my studying]]
- [[People who inspire my living]]
- [[People who inspire my sharing]]
- [[People who inspire my facilitating]]
- [[thoughts/people who inspire how i am connecting]]

Meanwhile, I try to look for [[People who inspire all my five categories of action]].
