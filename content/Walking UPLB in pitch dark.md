I remember the frogs and toads I would meet along the way when I go home at Sta. Maria.

Terrible darkness at uplb now
A guard at waiting shed
A runner
Few people walking
Cars

Guards huddled inside the guardhouse

I heard students say
Maaga tayong matutulog ngayon

Workers around the fire talking
Makiling's shadow
Students walking without lights
Riding bikes without lights
Walking voices

Students gathered outside their dorm around a single dim light still loud the guard perhaps putting up with all their noise vigorously fanning

I walk
My light moves with my feet
Touches the road touches the trees
I raise my head to the trees

Venus the only light visible

I heard about the cats
And my heart went to them
But in the evening i walked still
And saw a frog flattened on the ground
And felt almost nothing
How was I different from the driver?

How will we ever truly love?
Will we ever be consistent?
