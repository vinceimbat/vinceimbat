Dearest one,

If no one has told this to you, let me be the first, "I see your pain." I see what years of wandering in the wilderness have done to you, no matter how strong you are. I see you've grown tired. I see how you desire a place to lie down and rest, to quench your thirst, to call your own. And I see your many disappointments in learning that the places you thought were homes never were. I see the many nights you've tumbled on your bed thinking whether you should return to where you came from—a place where you had people you once loved and yet who will never love you for who you are. The alternative is to leave this world altogether with your own hands. But I see you cry because you know you can never do it, and this world is too beautiful to leave—this moment too precious to throw.

I see all of these and more. And yet, I am also here to tell you that you should feel good about how far this long walk has brought you. This wandering has led you to people you never expected to spark a fire within you, people who are also on the road—fellow walkers, fellow travelers. Like you, they aren't quite sure where to go but have embraced this not knowing.

And that is all that matters: to hear yourself for the first time and never to let go of your voice. Pay close attention to that voice. Never leave its side. For in that voice is the voice of so many others who will one day find you and build the house you've been looking for together. That time will come. I have unwavering faith in you. And when it does, I will be by your side, holding your hand, walking with you toward nowhere.

I love you.
