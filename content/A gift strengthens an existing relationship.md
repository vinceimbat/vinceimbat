One of Hyde's claims is that gifts strengthen relationships. This is something I want to question. In the internet, there are lots of free stuff, but I do not create that bond among those who give them for free.

Perhaps it is useful to differentiate between classic gift communities and modern ones. A classic gift community is local and smaller.
