[[thoughts/life is a project]]. Projects have goals ([[thoughts/connect a project with a goal]]). In life, we call goals "intentions". The better we set intentions and follow them through, the more we live an integrated life. And when we are mindful and present, we can reap the fruits of this integrated life.
