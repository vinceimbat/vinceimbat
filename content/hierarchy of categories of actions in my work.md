[[Living is the most important category of action]]. I am [[understanding]] because I want to know how to feel good. Studying informs what actions I take. Consequently, what I am [[sharing]] are things I learned from studying and applying them in daily [[living]]. This sharing, however, is tertiary. Living first then studying. This means that I am a researcher first before I am a writer.

Being good at living and thinking is more important than being a good writerâ€”it is also a harder work. Therefore, the [[Five areas of my life work]] are in a hierarchy:

1. Living
2. Studying
3. Sharing
4. [[thoughts/connecting]]
5. [[facilitating]]

I am putting connecting below sharing because I think it is easier to connect to others if one has already shared something and has something to show people.
