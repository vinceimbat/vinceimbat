I want my creative acts to cultivate [[understanding]] of the world as it really is. I want them to nurture a deep friendship with [[wisdom]], a friendship that helps me understand reality, uncover truth, and use it to act appropriately at each moment. Throughout this process, I am hoping to build a personal philosophy of living that is as honest as it is meaningful to me.

I want to use this personal philosophy of living to inform [[living]] itself. I want to act on what I am learning as much as possible. From applying my worldview in real life, I then collect feedback that I can use to iterate on it. My goal is that by living my wisdom, I live a life filled with meaning and happiness.
