After philosophizing, eventually we come to the conclusion that there are things we don't know. They are mysteries. Since other people also don't know about these things, we actually have free reign to imagine what is there and make large proclamations. Since no one can confirm what we are saying, we can easily say we are a conduit for a deity or another realm.

The best approach however is that if we don't know, we be honest about it and we be careful of our claims.
