When you lose faith and clarity in your own vision and work, prepare a “reset” that reminds you of why you create. Your reset could include the following:
- a quote from your hero
- a photo that sparks your imagination on what is possible
- a biography or documentary about someone who inspires you, or
- a song that centers you.

Here are other ideas you can do to encourage you:
- Use daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, or yearly reviews to write your progress.
- Recognize and honor your accomplishments no matter how small by writing them down every day.
- Have an “emergency call” list of three people who motivate you. These should be individuals you trust, who believe in the possibility of what you want to create, and would take your call without judgment.
