## While on a jeep
A parade for the dead
A boy
Just 6 years old
His photo shows eyes pitch dark
Engulfing the entire ball
The kabaong too small for anyone
The line too short
People here are friends of the child's parents, grandparents
His life too short to accomodate a longer line

Rewalking to relive memories?
The paths will no longer be the same. Will this mean that some things will forever be forgotten?

Wafted
Enraptured

Research: how to make money as an artist to fund your art

## While walking at Cablong
Lato-lato everywhere
Tricycle selling fish (weighing scale on large ice box)
Small girl child on small bicyle pulled by an older girl with an attached string

Walking is awkwardness training

Sometimes words come while walking. More often they arrive when I have arrived.

Create a universe

Burning bamboo
