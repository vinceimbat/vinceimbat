Better Living Through Xeroxography founded by [[Adam David]] and his wife [[Conchitina Cruz]]. It's an event where zinesters and small presses meet to sell new books and merchandises. It happens several times a year in different locations and has sometimes went to the regions.

# History of BLTX

According to one of its co-founders, Adam David, the first BLTX was organized after he wrote and published his manifesto entitled ["Better Living Through Xeroxography: Literary Patricide by Way of the Small Independent Press"](https://wasaaak.blogspot.com/2009/04/better-living-through-xeroxography.html) in 2 April 2009. The first expo, conceptualized and organized by [The Youth and Beauty Brigade](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=100067329506120) was held the following year on 3 December 2010 at a videoke bar called Ilyong's at Kalantiaw, Project Four, Quezon City. Since 2010, BLTX helped inspire the creation of small presses and independent publishers that have since co-organized and supported the expo that is now held multiple times a year in different parts of the Philippines.

David stated that he “put together a manifesto about weaponizing the small press to enact literary patricide, enabling actual artistic freedom.” The first expo was then later staged

The first expo was staged in Ilyong’s, a videoke bar along Kalantiaw, Project Four, on Dec. 3, 2010. The organizers shift with every event, depending on the particular needs of the specific time and place the expo-fora-workshops will be happening in, but for the last four years or so, it’s been co-organized by Gantala Press, Magpies Press, Studio Soup Zine Library, and the Youth & Beauty Brigade.
