The feeling that the town, province, or country where one came from is "backward" is a feeling brought by globalization: a process that has destroyed local economies, local cultures, and local ecologies. This process is a continuation of hundreds of years of colonialism. So the next time you think/utter "walang ganyan sa states," check again. Perhaps you dont know something you should know.
