I am committed to living a life filled with Ginhawa by developing [[thoughts/mindfulness]] and [[thoughts/understanding]], so I can always perform the right and compassionate [[thoughts/action]] in [[My life areas]].

I am committed to maintaining and improving my [[thoughts/life management system]], my mental and physical [[inbox/health]], my relationships, and my sustenance work, so that they support me in pursuing my vision and fulfilling my purpose ([[My life areas support my life work]]).

I am committed to building a world filled with Ginhawa by:

1. honoring [[My top values]] and living according to my principles in my daily life;
2. authentically expressing my ideas and stories through writing and other artforms in a way that is helpful to my audience;
3. nurturing a community and ecosystem of individual relationships with allies, peers, mentors, and followers; and
4. facilitating the development of skills, practices, and knowledge related to the fulfillment of my vision and purpose in others.
