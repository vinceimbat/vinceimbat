Research the following:

- Product names
- Products

Focus on customer research:
- what, when and how often customers want to buy (quantitative data)
- why they make their decisions (qualitative insights)
- why customers are currently buying or not buying from you
- what they may want to purchase from you in the future
- research current customers by identifying what they are purchasing from you and investigating why

Methods we can use:
- Customer survey
- Interviews
- Analyzing past performance (sales, refunds, and repeat business)

Purpose of customer research:
- understanding why sales are dropping
- finding out what customers need
- finding out what customers want from their relationship with you
- identifying value you can add to your current products and services
- building 2 or more distinctive customer segments and profiles that you will target--for example
    - business to consumer (B2C)
    - business to business (B2B)
    - business to government (B2G)
    - customers in certain age ranges or locations
    - customers with certain hobbies or interests.

Conduct regular customer research to refine your knowleedge of them and expand to more customer types.
