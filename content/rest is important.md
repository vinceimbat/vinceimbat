Once's consciousness of one's mortality is good as it fosters appreciation of the shortness of life. But that appreciation is compromised when one is unable to pause to rest and appreciate what one has accomplished no matter how small.

Nothing could mirror one's appreciation of the pause better than the length of one's sleep. What pause is more beautiful and more persistent than this? What if instead of scheduling sleep around work, I schedule work around sleep?

Life's [[meaning]] is enriched by doing. But our ability depends on our ability to rest.
