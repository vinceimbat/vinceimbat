Is it possible to have a worldview of existing in the world where I dont have to believe in all these metaphysical stuff I continue to revere nature and have this reverential relationship with it that helps in its preservation?

The throwness that the existentialist experienced can actually be reinterpreted, rephrased as the gift experience. We didn't chose this life but someone (chance, the universe, the laws of the universe) gifted it. This life is a gift experience. It might feel like a thrown experience at first, but once we interpret life as befriending existence, we might also start interpreting it as a gift, unwanted but given. And so everythin that flows from this state of giftedness can be said to come from a gift or has an element of gift.

Why did I cry?

Isn't this idea that things are gifts connected to why I feel strongly appreciative and grateful for the little things. This mindset of sentimentality, that things are transient and so sacred, these are all emanating from the nature of things as gifts.
