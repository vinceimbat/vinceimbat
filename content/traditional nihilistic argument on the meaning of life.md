The traditional nihilistic argument on the meaning of life follows the following line of thought:

1. God and a soul are necessary for meaning in life ([[Extreme supernaturalism]]).
2. Neither God nor a soul exists ([[Atheism]]).
3. Since God or the soul does not exist, life is inherently meaningless.

This position is now slowly replaced by newer arguments like [[error-theory-based nihilistic arguments on the meaning of life]].
