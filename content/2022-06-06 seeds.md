5-7 pm
Velasco-Aglibut-Capinpin-Sandoval-Narra-Gapud-Drilon

Tibig everywhere
A raindrop falls from a leaf to my arm
An insect hovers from one leaf to another
Water flowing below
Birds, or are these insects, making a stir above

Walking in the Philippines is like being a refugee and explorer and improvisionist at the same time. There are no trails. Only for hiking. You have to build your own routes.
