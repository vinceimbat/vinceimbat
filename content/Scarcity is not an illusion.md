Perhaps the illusion is the subjective experience of scarcity. However, I believe that at any given time, the Earthâ€™s resources are finite. Also, the Earth will stop existing eventually and with it all its resources. This is inescapable.

Note
- I believe I was responding to an argument made by Charles Eisenstein in one of his books (A Beautiful World?) when I wrote this note.
