# Hi, I'm Vince Imbat.

## I'm a [[writing|writer]] and [[photography|photographer]] exploring a [[jiyu shukyo|free and creative spirituality (jiyū shūkyō)]] through [[walking]].

***

This website is an [[archive]] of my footprints both in the walks I take in [[thoughts/mental wilderness|the wilderness of my mind]] and [[thoughts/geographical wilderness|the wilderness out there]]. In curating this website, I take inspiration from [[herbert fingarette|Herbert Fingarette's]] words:

>"These studies are outcomes rather than realised objectives. In making the journey, I have no aims. These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints."

Some projects I'm currently working on:

- [[talahardin|Talahardin]]: This website itself; an experiment in combining walking with an [[archive]] and a digital garden as a backbone for a creative writing and thinking practice based on the premise that [[art is never finished|art is never finished]].
- [[jiyu shukyo|Jiyū Shūkyō]]: An exploration and documentation of my conversion toward a [[a goodness lurking|free and creative spirituality]].
- [[walking|Walking]]: An attempt to understand the contemporary [[derive|dérive]] in contrast with my experience of walking and Filipino indigenous conceptions of walking to come up with a creative embodied avenue to explore a free and creative spirituality. Some walks I've done:
	- 2022 June 9–10: [[traversing liminality through walking|Los Baños to San Pablo walk ]]
	- 2023 April 20 and 27: [[nlai walk 1|"Nasa Labas ang Ili" (Home is Out There) guided walk]]
	- 2023 December 4–10: [[rxg|Roots x Gravel: A Week-long Walk of Los Baños]]
	- 2024 January 15–21: [[tall tales 1|Tall Tales: Baguio Walk No. 1]]
