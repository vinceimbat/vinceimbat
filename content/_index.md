# Hi, I'm Vince Imbat.

I'm a writer and photographer based in Los Baños, Laguna.

I'm deeply interested in matters of [[religion]], [[spirituality]], and [[philosophy]], and I try to engage with these subjects through solitary [[walking]].

Welcome to my little home in the web. This website tracks my footprints both in my [[thoughts/mental wilderness|mental wilderness]] and the [[thoughts/geographical wilderness|geographical wilderness]]. I adopted the word "footprints" as used by [[Herbert Fingarette]]:

>"These studies are outcomes rather than realised objectives. In making the journey, I have no aims. These studies are intellectual footprints, not blueprints."

Some projects I'm currently working on:

- [[thoughts/talahardin|Talahardin]]: This website itself; an experiment in using a [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|digital garden]] as a backbone for creative writing and thinking based on the premise that [[thoughts/art is never finished|art is never finished]]
- [[essays/a goodness lurking|Free, creative, and subsistent spirituality]]: My ongoing research and documentation of my conversion toward liberal religion
- [[thoughts/walking los baños|Walking Los Baños]]
- [[thoughts/walking baguio|Walking Baguio]]

I also send a weekly newsletter called [**The Long Walk**](https://vinceimbat.substack.com/). It's a newsletter about philosophical and contemplative living through walking and writing. It's free and you can unsubscribe any time. Join by leaving your email below.
