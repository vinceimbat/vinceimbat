I was introduced to the essay in high school when I started writing formal themes, articles for the school paper, and entries for contests. But I fell in love to the essay because of [[Dave Ursillo]] and blogging. I love how it helped me listen to myself closer. It was an extension of my diary (or other writing I did in private). The essay helped me understand my life better, and the more I wrote about my life, the more I wanted to be better. The possibilities of the essay was, of course, expanded by my [[ANWW20]] experience in 2023. I learned how to use the essay to explore the world and my relationship in it. It taught me to experiment with form through it. I would like to continue using the essay as a way for me to understand myself as I begin to understand the world around me better.
