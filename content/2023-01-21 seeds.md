Dampalit falls is inflation proof.

If I didn't learn from the terrible things that happened to me, then all of them would have been useless. How do I ensure that I learn?

Something I observe from myself and others:

Personal experiences of suffering make us think more of ourselves. Initially, this is good. It motivates us to take better care of ourselves. But then we could easily overdo this. We could easily obsess about ourselves--obsess about our own suffering and how we're so great dealing with it. This, in turn, results to more suffering, which results to more thinking about ourselves. And so on.

When we are in this vicious cycle, the only way to break it is to start thinking about others.
