My goal for this game is to create a gaming environment where people stop, pause, reflect, and think.

Careful thinking is required in the game to achieve understanding and make tough decisions about actions to take.

Each player is a philosopher or spiritual leader.

Perhaps the role choosing process can best be done if the player is aigned with the philosphy of the group. Perhaps a short quiz at the beginning to identify oneâ€™s character?

What will happen in the game is that players are faced with tough decisions:

- make a tradeoff
- express their values through that tradeoff

But if it is a game, there will be losers and winners. There is a right and wrong action.

Events, resources, inner state

The player should balance between:

- Being alive
- Fulfilling the mission
- General compassion

Making decisions that involve slef-interest vs others

Constraints

- Time - The game is limited in time. Should there be a time limit? Or could time be a currency instead that can be used to take actions.

The different resources

- Time
- Mental spae
- Money
- Life energy (health)

Actions

- Improve health (1 year + 2 coins) = 2 years
- Improve money (1 year + 2 health) = 2 coins
- Pursue mission (1 year + 2 coins + 2 health)

There will be two parts of the game.

1. Growth - This is where players build their individual paths
2. Event - This is when a large cataclysmic event happens (war, pandemic, ecological collapse, depression)
