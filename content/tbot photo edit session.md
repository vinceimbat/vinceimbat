These are notes I took on one of [[craig mod|Craig Mod's]] [[things become other things mod|TBOT]] photo edit session.

***

Take both landscape and portrait photos to consider printing on books

When you do prints, you need to do texture bumps (e.g., clarity).

He tweaks a lot of Temperature (not much of tint etc.)

Vignette using masking and exposure.

House style
- Natural (naturalistic photography, not studio)
- Warm
- Avoid HDR
- Light-focused (focuses on how he sees the light at that moment)

He seems to use cloudy a lot?

For shadows, don't go to loosing details. 10% black as the lowest. Unless you are going for a full contrast photo.

Even low exposed photos can work as long as you see small patches of light. Focus on the light.

Shoot low exposed because it is easier to pull out details from shadows than fully exposed photos.

For shadows, print test files to see their relationship on paper.

He seldom touches White and Black. Just Shadows, Exposure, and Highlights.

Doesn't seem to touch Contrast too.

For texture, touches Clarity more often.

For forest scenes with lots of greens, it's ok to emphasize the greens via temperature.

Leave big color corrections for later in your process.

(I want to create not fix my systems.)

It's hard to decide which photos are in and out until you start pairing them.

Remember that your audience don't have an emotional connection to these images. You have. So think about how they will receive them.
