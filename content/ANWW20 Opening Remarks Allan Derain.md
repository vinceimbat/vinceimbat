Hybridity not just in form but also in process and publication.

Essay as neutral ground for hybridity

Genre divisions have formed generations of writers

Genre are discourses (flow of communities)

Being in time ni Heidegger
- dasain

(Hybridity is related to my philosophical studies - evocative philosophy)

What can an essayist learn from other genres?

Mikael Bhaktin - dialogic imagination

Si Rizal ba sa El Fili ay gumamit ng dialogic imagination?

Should dialogic imagination be performed?

Scholarly + literary = dasain (more than literary and scholarly)

I was building the grounds for autoethnography without knowing it

(Notes pa lamang ito)

Ellipses ang mga works (pagpapatuloy)

Safe space for experimentation

AILAP
- Paano payamanin ang mga existing konsepto
- Wag masyado sa technicals and functional

Literary world chisms

Essay as form by adorno

Mushroom at the end of the world

History of the wind

Lyrical essay / lyrical philosophy

Essayistic tendencies

Genre is an illusion
