Nature has always called to me—to live near it, to communite with it, and to study it. Nature is the outside world, which even my physical body is a part of. It is that which is apart from my "soul" (i.e., [[subjective experience exists|my subjective experience]]).

Nature  is without subjectivity. It is bland, neutral, and objective ([[an external objective physical world exists]]). Its study is a source of both joy and enlightenment. A communion with it is a lesson on [[Non-attachment]]—to values, thoughts, beliefs, and preferences.

But, at the same time, needing Nature means needing attachment. Because I am closely intertwined with the rest of the world—both in terms of my physical body and my mind.

To be with nature, to live with nature, to protect and preserve it for the purposes I said above—this is what it means to be fully human.
