The purpose statement in the [[Sky level]] of my [[thoughts/life management system]] answers the question “Why do I exist?” If [[thoughts/life is a project]], then a life [[thoughts/purpose]] is the reason behind the [[thoughts/action]]s I take in life.

My purpose statement is written here: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]].
