Paano iwoworkshop ang mga ito?

Points of inquiry
- pakiramdam
- structure of choice
- discourse itself
- lapit (sensibility of essay)

Hati
1. Personal
2. Social
3. Suguilon
4. Conclusion

## Discourse

Tinatapunan niya ng duda ang statements ng government.
- Papaano natin paniniwalaan si Ryan kung hindi natin nakita ang nakita niya at pinagdaanan ito?

Jehu
- Nabasa ba ng mga Manobo ang essay? (Dahil sa colonial history ng anthropology.)
- What if co-author si Datu Ugking
- Positionality

Kinapture si Datu Ugking ng militar.
Ethical ba na isulat ito?
Ang kuwento bang ito ay kay Datu o sa komunidad?

## Lapit

Paano nakaapekto ang political inclination ni Ryan sa essay.

Discussion is going towards linear rather than dialectical. (Pinasisinungalingan ang AFP)

Dapat pag-usapan yung division between IPs (IPs used by gov vs IP themselves) kaysa yung narrative division between government ang Manobo.

The community is not homogenous.
Bakit ko isusulat ito? Para ke?
Research fatigue. Andaming research pero walang change sa community.

It is a problem of form. We write the subject entirely but decide what form you tell the story.

Now that you know the truth, what will you do with it?

The Left is alienating.

Where to position yourself? I am a writer and artist and I go for the truth and the nuanced. Am I a centrist?

Essay is doing an erasure.

Ano ang side ng AFP? - Amanda

Footnote lamang masaker at suguilon.
- Dapat nagtatagpo sila pero parang nag-iikutan lang sila.
- Hinahanap kun nasaan sila magtatagpo.

Ang claim ng komunidad ay maibalik sa komunidad.

authoring vs. deauthoring Datu Ugking
- since he abandoned the work, an author can change
- who is the author?
- confirmation process in anthro
- people within the community have criticisms about their own sources, stories. They don't see it all as sacred. It is like a fairytale only. Be conscious of how they see it.

Those manobos who align with the government, are they not part of the community?
Not believing in homogeniety

What are our commitments?
- Not sector or class but alliance of sectors and class.
- You don't have to let go of your commitment, just recognize the nuances.

Be careful of sources within IPs (the sources do not represent the entire community but specific parts of the community)

Napagdaanan na ba iyon ni Ryan?

nagaaway ang footnotes sa content: marami sa footnotes ay personal
suguilon quoted within the text instead of appendix and paraphrased

Hindi ako nahigop ng kuwentong ito. - Luna
- May obligasyon tayong ilarawan sila at ikuwento sila.
- Epikong Kudamat?
- Paano ba tayo mahihigop ng sanaysay ni Ryan?
- Primary task ang pagsasalaysay

Repition and ambivalence performed.

Bring us to the place and describe it.

Writings ni Nemo, Tito Valiente.

Lebel ng pag-uulit.

Ang sanaysay ay isang performance (pagtatanghal)
- Nasaan ang pag-uulit?
- Very anthropological.
- Kung pag-uulit, hindi umaakma ang anyong anthropoligical essay sa paksang napili.

Issues of identity and representation is connected with the issue of repetition.

Bring yourself.

Tabihan mo siya ng literary analysis instead of paraphrase. Nagsiside commentary ka lang ng sugilon.

Close reading - nakita mo na ito at hindi namin makikita kung hindi mo nakita.

Myfel Paluga ? paguulit

Dr. Christin Moika
- Very specific conclusion without making grand claims.
- Ending: the goal is that it should be remembered.

The literary production context was different. When workshoped, iba na ang context. Will you follow the lead?

Pag-uulit ng mga aktibista?

Sino ang audience mo? Saan papunta?
What is the urgency of your project?
this is important because you traverse politics and literature
- These are important questions because they motivate you as a writer.

*NOTE: Add these questions: What is the goal of the essay? Who is the audience? What is the context of the essay?

Writing for them, with them, and together with them?

Walang autoethnography, that is what ethnography should be.

Joanna
Where is the hybridity here?
- Where is auto?
- Ethno and ideology is good.
- Auto-ethnography: How is the self change by doing the ethnography.
- hybridize using "close reading" (some at p. 14)

autoethnomethodology
- your ethnography changes how you write.
- how does what you saw change the way you are writing?

The words do not have to be defined but you have to present them culturally with their spirit.

Can the piece be the embodiment of the peace pack.

The violence of the pangayaw should arise in the text too.
