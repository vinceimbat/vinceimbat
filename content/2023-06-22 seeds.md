- [[thoughts/we take for granted previous hopes]]

Some days ago, Lea and I talked about how some of the things we take for granted now were just dreams we would kill to have in the past. Case in point: I once dreamt of living far away from home like in Southern Luzon. Now that is the case. And yet I take it for granted and want to change my situation and transfer.

I am reminded of this after reading from Solnit's Wanderlust how walking which set the stage for the development of human intelligence is now considered backward.
