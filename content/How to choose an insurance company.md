Choose a company with a good history and reputation. Check how long they have been in business. Check their financial strength. Review annual reports of companies. Go for a company that is part of the top 10 best performing.

Majority of the companies have the same products. They only differ in marketing and customer service.

To choose a company, see [[Top Insurance Providers in the Philippines]].
