[[use a note-writing system]] that is simple. All you need is:

1. An undistracted brain
2. A reliable collection of notes

For your collection of notes ([[talahardin]]), you should have a bare minimum of four tools:

1. [[inboxes to capture fleeting notes]].
2. A [[reference management system]].
3. The slip-box
4. An editor

When using tools, remember that [[tools should be embedded in a system to be effective]].
