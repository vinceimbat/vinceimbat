Today, I subscribe to the following beliefs about the act of creation:
1. Creativity should be a vehicle to maximize complete freedom. I subscribe to what [[ann lauterbach|Ann Lauterbach]] said: "Poetry protects language from serving any master."
2. Creativity, because it involves action, is saying, "I choose to live this life which I didn't choose for myself, which was gifted to me, and which I could easily abandon by killing myself." Therefore, creativity if befriending life, embracing it, an effort to see what good can be taken from it.
3. Creativity, is therefore, a way to create meaning in what is a meaningless world.

Seeing life through this metaphor makes [[walking]] relevant and writing walking excursions appropriate.
