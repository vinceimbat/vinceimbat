This is my current [[life management system]] [[ground level]] setup.

I am currently using the following inboxes to capture my loose ends:

- Messages: email, iMessage, Messenger
- Files: Downloads, Desktop, Google Drive Inbox
- Analog notes: Journals
- Digital notes: Drafts
- Writing Inbox: [[writing inbox]]
- Reading Inbox: [[reading inbox]]

My clarified notes go to [[Obsidian]].

My clarified tasks go to [[Things]].

My clarified events go to Google Calendar.

My clarified reading materials go to Instapaper.

My projects list is housed in Things and is updated weekly.

My areas list is located in both Things and Obsidian.

My resources are located both in Obsidian and Finder.

My archives are in Finder and my paper filing system.

For my backup system, I do daily backups on my hard drive using Carbon Copy Cloner and on the cloud using Backblaze.
