# Summary

September 2024 was a very full month. My spiritual life was enriched by returning to yoga after a long time as I practiced with a group one Saturday morning. I also finally had the chance to talk with Toby about our spiritual lives and even succeeded to invite hime to join a Kiitsu Kyokai meeting. In the last Kiitsu Kyokai meeting of the month, I was reunited with Nathan and met a new participant, Lizzie. I attended two group seiza meditations this month and after one of these sessions, I was invited to join a Jodo Shinshu discussion.

I also did a lot of writing this month. After writing [[uman 2024-08]] and publishing it via Sendy for the first time, I worked on several applications. I studied the Pangasinan orthography suggested by Pablo Mejia and applied it to improve the salaysay I sent for GBL. I translated and revised some poems and essays as entries for the Palihang Kataga. I sent an application to INWW. I also prepared poems and photos for the Kalooban Exhibit.

September is my anniversary month with Lea and for this year, we decided to celebrate our anniversary by returning to Binondo. We also attended our first MIBF where we bought books to support our friends. I got my books signed, chatted with friends and authors, and attended the No Format panel discussion by Ateneo. The first book I finished from MIBF was Ivan Labanye's Beckoning Baguio.

This month we also bonded with friends. I had my first walk with Ivan. We had our first game night with Maui, Yano, and Ron then dinner at Little India with Persis after. Finaly, we met JuWa at Meister's and talked.

This month, I got a new gig. My proposal to design the Mahalina website was accepted and I began immersing in the organization and working on the project. After receiving feedback, I also improved my working process for updating GIC and OVIC. I also improved our couple financial system. Lea also had a breakthrough. She got hired to a hybrid full-time role.
