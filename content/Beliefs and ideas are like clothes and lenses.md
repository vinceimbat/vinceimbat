Perhaps beliefs and ideas are most useful when they are treated like clothes .... Tried on for a period of time and then taken off, run through the laundry and then taken out again at an appropriate occasion. Or perhaps a better analogy is that they are like lenses ... Some help see far away, some magnify the unseen microscopic world, and some just help bring what is before us into better focus.
