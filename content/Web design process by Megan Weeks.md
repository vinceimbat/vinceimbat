Length: 10-12 weeks (More than two months)

## Contact Form

- Contains way to book a discovery call.
- Contains questions that will be helpful during discovery call.
	- Budget range (this immediately filters less ideal clients)
	- Where is their business at right now?
	- Explain a bit about their business.

## Discovery Call

- First question: Do they have branding? If the client has no branding yet, she doesn't take the project. She directs them to doing branding first with her.
- Next: Is it an ecommerce or just informational website? Ecommerce websites are more expensive and time-consuming.

## Proposal

- Tell them you will send a proposal in two days.
- Customize and make it nice.
- Go everything we discussed.
- Include package details, start date, and payment plan.

## Client portal

- Prerequisites:
	- Client has accepted the proposal.
	- Client has signed the contract.
	- Client has sent the deposit.

- Send login details for client portal.
- Send another questionnaire for their business needs.
- Prepare a video explaining where their taskboard and messages are located

## Initial homepage designs

- Once the questionnaire is filled up, start the project.
- Start with homepages and provide two to three designs (at least two of these should be completely different) to choose from.
- If there are no copies and images ready, use placeholder copies and images.

## Feedback on designs

- Adjust to the communication preferences of the client.
- Adobe XD allows you to comment on specific parts of the design.
- Give them 4-5 questions to answer to facilitate their feedback giving.

## Design interior pages

- Also any edits to the home page
- Find inspiration from different places
- Use home page design to direct the design of the other pages
- You don't need to mockup each product page, just one sample is enough.
- Always provide a video run-through of why you designed what you designed.

## Get feedback and hire copywriter

- This round of feedback is so important. When you get to development, you don't want a lot of editing. Emphasize this to the client also.
