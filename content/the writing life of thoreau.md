Walls, Laura Dassow. _Henry David Thoreau: A Life_. First edition, University of Chicago Press, 2017.

p. 4

>This choice will set him off from family, friends, and neighbors—unlike them, Henry David Thoreau would be a _writer_. This meant taking up the writer’s double consciousness, splitting the self who lives from the self who writes, opening up a double vision: present and past, white and Indian, civil and wild, man and nature.

p. 9

>No American writer is more place centered than Thoreau.

>He learned this himself when he moved to New York City and tried to be like other writers, mobile and market driven. It was a disaster. But back home the smallest things—like the way the sandy soil breaks through the grass, “the naked flesh of New England her garment being blown aside”—moved him to rhapsody

>What the Indian had by birth, Thoreau claimed through art, a spiritual rebirth for himself and his own immigrant people. His longing for a deep connection with the land would make _Walden_ into the great American fable of alienation, regrounding, and rebirth.

>Thoreau used the specifics of place to embody deeper and more universal truths.

>To grasp Thoreau means grasping where he was and how it became that way.

p. 62 (Commonplace books)

>There in the stacks Thoreau began his lifelong habit of keeping a permanent record of his reading by copying extracts into commonplace books. He developed a passion for English poetry from Chaucer to Shakespeare

p. 75 (Reading list)

>When Thoreau arrived back at Harvard, he began working through Brownson’s reading list: the latest European literature and philosophy—Goethe and Coleridge, Heine, Cousin, Constant. He bought Brownson’s _New Views_ and Emerson’s _Nature_ for his personal library

p. 122

>Clearly Thoreau had confided to Fuller what he had barely confessed to himself: he longed to go away and live by the pond and be the writer he dreamed of becoming.

>Under Emerson’s roof, Thoreau consolidated his sense of himself as above all a writer—not a dilettante who published occasionally, but a true and focused professional patterned after Emerson’s own model, which Thoreau now witnessed daily.

p. 123

>So Emerson had another idea: Thoreau would go to Harvard, ransack the library, and select the best of British poetry for an anthology—the “old” to America’s “new”—learning his craft by total immersion in the discipline of poetry.

>They all seemed so tame and civil, as if not a one of them had seen so much as “the west side of any mountain”

>Thoreau felt more “kith and kin” with the lichen on the bare winter branches than with anything in these books. His yearning for wildness struck him as peculiar, his one redeeming quality, even as it isolated him from all of literary history.

p. 144 (Thoreau's poetry)

>Henry’s limitations as an editor were one thing; his shortcomings as a poet were another. Fuller had rejected almost all his poetry

>This, too, pained Fuller, who complained that Thoreau’s tin ear had ruined his best poem

>This, the peak of Thoreau’s career as a poet, was the beginning of the end. An embarrassed Emerson sat him down and critiqued his poems, pulling no punches. For all their “honest truth” and “rude strength,” they lacked beauty. “Their fault is, that the gold does not yet flow pure, but is drossy & crude. The thyme and marjoram are not yet made into honey; the assimilation is imperfect.”

>After five years dedicated to poetry, Thoreau was devastated. Emerson never printed another Thoreau poem. Thoreau himself slipped in three more when he edited the April 1843 issue, including two of his greatest, “Smoke” and “Haze.” But from then on, Emerson’s designated poet would be Ellery Channing.

p. 157 (experience as a writer at New York)

>To his family he spilled out the grim details: he was pounding New York’s streets without effect, pushing into the offices of every bookseller and publisher, only to be told they had no money to pay contributors, or if they did—like the Harper brothers, on their way to founding a publishing empire—they were unwilling to chance an unknown writer.

>“Literature comes to a poor market here, and even the little that I write is more than will sell.”

p. 190-192 (writing at Walden)

>But now, instead of claiming a little space in a communal house, an alcove or attic, he would claim an entire life, and declare that writing would be not an occasional hobby but the central hub of his whole being. From now on, Thoreau would be a writer in an entirely new sense: instead of living a little, then writing about it, his life would be one single, integrated act of composition.

>“I wish to meet the facts of life—the vital facts . . . face to face, and so I came down here. Life! who knows what it is—what it does?”

>This declaration of purpose has the force of a vow, a sacred commitment to confront, “face to face,” the conditions of possibility for life itself.

>“Nothing so sudden, nothing so broad, nothing so subtle, nothing so dear, but it comes therefore commended to his pen, & he will write. In his eyes a man is the faculty of reporting, & the universe is the possibility of being reported.”

>Thoreau had no guarantee that his experiment would work. He knew only that he had to try. This was literally his last move. “If I am not quite right here I am less wrong than before,”

>His purpose was profoundly religious.

>And writing? After the long lapse of centuries, it was time “for the written word—the _scripture_—to be heard.”

>Instead of collating scriptures, now he would write one, a new sacred book for the modern age.

p. 196-197 (A Week and Walden)

>The immediate result of all this was that Thoreau, who went to Walden to write one book, instead wrote two.

>_A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers_

>As _A Week_ grew in range and depth, so did Thoreau’s understanding of the ways the Industrial Revolution was already

>For years Thoreau had been collecting passages for it in the “Long Book,” adding paragraphs as they came to him, building it up piece by piece like a mosaic.

>Into _A Week_, this intensely personal and private work of his Walden days, Thoreau poured all the best of his younger self, all the passion and poetry of three decades.

>_Walden_

>It was born on July 5, 1845, his first morning at the pond, when he opened a new journal by announcing why he’d come there to live.

>bold, lyric, yearning, prophetic, confrontational. It’s the voice not of a confiding poet but of a prophet, a teacher discovering how—since, it turns out, he’s up on a soapbox—to speak in a way that others will hear.

>From then on, there were two Thoreaus: one quiet, introspective, self-questioning, intensely private, occasionally depressed, and often in poor health; the other brash, boastful, self-certain, loud, and healthy as the rooster crowing to bring in the dawn.

>Modulating between these two self-extremes would open up, in the years to come, the full resources of Thoreau’s artistry. He would ever after wrestle uneasily with this new creation, “Thoreau,” this outsize doppelgänger born in those first conversations over the pine timbers of a house still raw with pitch and splinters, who would grow up to narrate his creator’s life to the entire world.

p. 242

>Blake gave Thoreau what he most needed: the conviction that he had something to say and an audience to whom he could say it.

p. 243

>At Walden, Thoreau had learned how to live a writer’s life; now at Emerson’s, he was living it still, surrounded by manuscripts in various stages of composition, a different project for every mood and interest, each one finding its unique voice and stance relative to the others and all of them together composing a literary ecology.

p. 329-330

>Without such a stable and contented homelife, Thoreau could not possibly have pursued his career in the way that he did. His attic chamber in the Yellow House became Walden-on-Main, a room of his own in an equitable and interdependent household in which everyone helped out.

>To Thoreau even the most ordinary sounds were music, and his journal records the many “melodies” that reached him, little vignettes of ambience: warm summer evenings when neighbors and farmers “come a-shopping after their day’s haying are chatting in the streets and I hear the sound of many musical instruments and of singing from various houses”

p. 381 (Wild Fruits)

>In these darkening and haunted pages of his Journal, Thoreau began to trace the outlines of _Walden_’s sequel: he would call it _Wild Fruits_, and it would be his final harvest.

p. 401 (journal content)

>Thoreau had, for all his glacial meditations on solitude, been filling his Journal with canny studies of his friends and neighbors, taking them up quite like leaves.

p. 435

>But in this hidden molten core Thoreau was fusing and transforming his accumulated years of scientific study into a new kind of instrument, a musical instrument, where every object was a key that, struck, resonated across hidden chambers of memory and meaning. He called it his “Kalendar,” but it was far more: a symphonic rotation capable of fusing and igniting a lifetime’s immersion in a single, beloved, deeply known New England village. In his youth Thoreau had imagined writing “a poem to be called Concord”; now, on his worn green writing desk, that great poem was taking shape.

>The problem was how to be heard when nearly everything he wrote had been rejected, ignored, or censored. While his outer self was professional—dry and workmanlike—in private he was incandescent, phosphorescing in the dark like a stick of Maine foxfire. When he identified a new species of fish, in public he proudly presented it to his scientific colleagues, who duly recognized him while they argued over its taxonomy. But in private he wrote in awe of “those little striped breams poised in Walden’s glaucous water,” unseen since Tahatawan paddled his canoe on those same waters. Walden was wild again, and America was young again. But how could he get beyond mere description? He must poise his thought “there by its side and try to think like a bream for a moment.” He thought of jewels, music, poetry, beauty, the mystery of life: “The bream, appreciated, floats in the pond as the centre of the system, another image of God.” He must convey what mattered most: the bream as “a living contemporary, a provoking mystery.”
