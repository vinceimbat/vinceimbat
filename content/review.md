A review in the context of a [[life management system|life management system]] is any process that prompts me to look back at an [[intention|intention]] I set and the [[action|action]] (or series of actions) I took to accomplish the intention. The purpose of looking back ([[thoughts/pay attention to what we pay attention to|pay attention to what we pay attention to]]) is to know whether I'm living a life of integrity, i.e, my actions produce end states that match my intentions ([[an action succeeds if its end state approximates its intention|an action succeeds if its end state approximates its intention]]). Reviews allow a life management system to perform one of its most important functions: to be at peace with our choices of action.

Life is super complex. [[thoughts/how to build a life management system|My life management system]] needs to be simple to accommodate my mind's limitations. But it shouldn't be too simple. Complexity should be allowed. [[thoughts/frequency of reviews simplifies complexity|The frequency of reviews simplifies life's complexity]] I can't handle the entire complexity in one moment. But I can do so in different moments scattered across intervals. This is design. Design allows for an efficient life management system, where actions are managed and are in integrity with [[convergence tool|convergence tools]] like [[purpose|purpose]], [[vision statement|vision statement]], and [[mission statement|mission statement]].

Review systems must:

- happen at regular intervals,
- follow a checklist format, and
- connect both actionable and reference systems.

I conduct four kinds of reviews

- [[thoughts/daily review|daily review]]
- [[weekly review|weekly review]]
- [[monthly review|monthly review]]
- [[thoughts/annual review|annual review]]

The key to regularly performing these reviews (except the daily review) is reminders, since it is difficult to establish habits that are not daily.
