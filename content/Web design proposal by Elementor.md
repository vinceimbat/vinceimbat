Two main ingredients of a proposal:
- Thorough research and evaluation
- Coherent composition

## Thorough research and evaluation

### In-depth interview with the client

1. Understand the clients needs and problems and the way they see it.

Questions
- Why does our client need a website? (Or why do they want to change the one that they already have?)
- What are their expectations of a new website? 
- In what way are they expecting the new site to affect their business?
- How does their website fit into their digital [marketing strategy](https://blog.wishpond.com/post/115675438227/video-marketing-strategy)? Do they invest in SEO (search engine optimization) and/or paid acquisition? 
- To what extent will the site promote and showcase products and services in the near future?
- Does the client hope to interact with visitors on the site? If so, how?
- Who is their competition? What are they doing to get ahead? 
- What is their inspiration? What sites, images, layouts do they, or their customers, find most appealing?

2. Listen to their answers attentively.
3. Evaluate your abilities and expertise.
4. Evaluate your resources and materials.
5. Evaluate your availability.

## Structure

1. The Client's Need (Problem)
2. Our Proposed Solution
3. Deliverables (optional section; the solution as an end-product) - you can make it a separate part or combine it with the next section
4. Proposed Workflow or Schedule
5. Price Quote - Just show that your prices are justifiable

Provide a pricing system to be competitive and avoid undercutting yourself.
