poetics: body -> personal
philosophy: not inside the box but without the box

lyrical philosophy

is leaning towards intellectual readers a trap?

Tapos na ba ang digmaan tungkol sa privacy ng babae?

mere anatomical part seems to suggest something

ekphrasis as method (meditating upon a work)
 
autotheory is ekphratic
while reading, we are also in inscape.

Actors notes?

Serious self-awareness.

Advice
- We have a canon.
- Merly Iluna - same topic
- there is a visceral, actual, and bodied experience of motherhood (this makes comparing creativity to motherhood problematic)

Eve Elsier
- Vagina monologues
- more effective in regional languages
- must be contextualized to Philippine context and masses

There are different kinds of the birthing process that can be compared with creativity. Deformed children etc.

The body you are auto-theorizing is changing, in flux.

Paano makatutulong ang pakikinig sa ibang may nagmamay-ari ng katawan ang pwedeng magpalalim sa scope.

Ellen Sisu should have been included in the essay.
Urbana at Felisa
- ano na ba ito ngayon?

Deepen the method and style.

The choice of a sculptor as ekphratic object for an essay about feminine body is interesting.

Scuplture is feminine.
Painting is masculine. - distance

Develop the curatorial style.

Kaganapan, Abueva

Foreground how a male sculptor does this vs. female

Sa Ngalan ng Ina

No anthologies for women's experiences like abortion etc.

Labor is the key word.
- This is where the potential is.
- Focus on more contemporary issues.

Recipes - issues of domestic labor? emotional labor?

artistic and writerly labor. (use as an inspiration the labor of Arellano to produce the sculpture)

Forbidden Fruit
Songs of Ourselves

Dely Aguilar
- intersectional and international

Jing Panganiban, Susong Susong Suso
- personal essay

Ekphrasis
- art criticism na hindi naman talaga
- paralelismo? papuntang contrast? kasi may dissonance.
- ekprasis dapat nagtatagpo ang essay at art work.

Grace's work alienates and that is where it gets its power.
- the essay diminishes the monstrosity.

Same na labor pero comparable ang sakit?

kung salita lang ang suporta, dapat hindi ipinapahalata ito on the act. Dapat sa dulo na.

If under birth process, then play with syntax and form. Resort to poetry, metaphors, etc. Difficult to say outright.

Maybe use other metaphors as painful as giving birth.

Add more info about 

As women we are allowed to see our writing how we want. - Hunny

Writing through the body establishes a "counter penis."

is there even an objective statement of childbirth as a metaphor.

Men can only think of childbirth theoretically.

Unfair ang mundo dahil tinanggalan tayo ng karanasan. Pero magugustuhan mo ba yun? - Guieb

Castels
- critical to literary
- new ways of living, new ways of loving, new ways of making babies

human relations
- relation with sculpture
- relation with mother's body

paglilinis ng puke ng nanay
- I was part of that privacy but it feels like violent

viscerality of childbirth vs. philosophical understanding with childbirth

You shouldn't compare something you have rejected with writing.

The negation is the poetics?

Curatorial + Personal

Highlights
- Sisu was insignificant
- monstrosity of Arellano's work is tamed by essay
- childbirth metaphor is not homogenous; may be oppressive
- consider gender positions that are "unmotherable"
- violations of privacy that don't only happen between two women but also different genders and different ages
- expand intended readership
