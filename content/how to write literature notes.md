It is important to [[Write permanent notes about what you read to test understanding]]. However, it is distracting to switch back and forth between reading a book and writing [[evergreens]].

Applying the [[thoughts/getting things done]] approach it is best to separate capturing [[Loose ends]] and processing them (see [[Barbell method of reading]]). Then, follow this process:
- For physical books, write notes directly on a note in [[Zotero]] or draw a dot or line in the margin of interesting passages. You will have to set a reminder to look into these markings when processing the book.
- For web articles, copy+paste interesting excerpts into a note in Zotero.
- For digital books and PDFs, export highlights and annotations in Zotero.

When you are ready to work on a note, create a working note in your [[writing inbox]] where you start to play around with these literature notes.

These notes shall remain in the writing inbox until processed iteratively via a [[thoughts/spaced repetition writing system]]. Use the process in [[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]] to create permanent notes.
