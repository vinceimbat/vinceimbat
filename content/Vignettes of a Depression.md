On March 11, 2021, I "celebrated" the 10th-year anniversary of my depressive episode. A few days before that anniversary, I recounted my depression story to a Â friend, which made me realize that retelling my story can have a powerful effect on me and the people who hear it. To honor this single most important experience of my life, I decided to publish a series of vignettes of my depression story via my newsletter. The series was never finished.
