One of our panelists in [[PRS17]], which I was able to converse with. He is the award-winning author of [[distrungka barrameda|Distrungka]], [[salvacion barrameda|Salvacion]], and [[virac barrameda|Virac]].

Many of his books are [[creative nonfiction]] and autobiographical. I relate to his works' sense of liminality and travel.
