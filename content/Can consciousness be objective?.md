Action needs consciousness. With that consciousness comes the possibility of preference. Preference is what drives action.

Consciousness -> Preference -> Action

So the question is: Is this seeing things as they really are truly possible? Or does seeing, since it is an action, automatically driven by preference?

It is still possible to generate absolute truth just by rationalization, so I guess it is possible?
