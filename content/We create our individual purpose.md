[[subjective experience exists]], and even if we can reject [[Free will]], [[The perception of free will is undeniable]]. Because we have a subjective experience (i.e., we have a [[thoughts/mind]]) and we have the will to create its contents, we are able to create [[thoughts/purpose]].

[[There is no single universal mind]] and, [[thoughts/subjective experiences are unique to each human being]]. Therefore, each human being creates their own purpose. [[There is no single purpose everyone must follow]] and [[thoughts/there is no destiny]]. We seem to enter life with a tabula rasa, and we create what we paint on it ([[Do we enter the world with a tabula rasa?]]).

When we get to the point where we want to create purpose, there are [[Ways to create our individual purpose]].
