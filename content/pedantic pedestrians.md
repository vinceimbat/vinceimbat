Baguio-based art collective whose leader [[Ivan Labanye]] relocated to [[los banos|Los Ba√±os]] in 2023. They release a digital magazine called Tila. One of the issues of the magazine used the layout of The Watchtower.

Similar to [[Bangko collective]], this group is anarchic in organization. It grew from a circle of friends who want to do art together. Their poetics is more underground and alternative, so they join [[BLTX]].
