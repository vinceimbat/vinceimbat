Rest, a feeling that everyone is at rest
Silent cars
Silent houses
Dogs barking

Walking projects are time-bound as are all projects. But there is always the risk that one may no longer walk either through sickness, disability, or old age. And so to do a walking project is to be reminded of one's mortality. One balances presence and hastiness.

The rythmic sound of my feet on the slipper.

Beliefs embedded in the landscape
Doctrines materialized embodied
How do we free from them and is it possible?
