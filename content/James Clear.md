Big Media Outlets

What makes a good content?

- [ ] Focus on the reader
- [ ] People buy results
- [ ] They don’t buy ideas
- [ ] Think of the underlying desire
- [ ] You can’t invent the desire
- [ ] Don’t think that simply because something is interesting people have a desire for it
- [ ] Work on an existing desire and tackle it in a different way
- [ ] Effort matters
- [ ] Headlines
- [ ] Focus on evergreen content
- [ ] Find the right audience

Find one thing that works and repeating that one thing a million times

get out there

Try as many things as possible

If you see something that works

Do more of that

Positioning

- [ ] Ex: Derek Halpern

Relationships

- [ ] Get to know people in the industry

**James Clear’s Thought Leadership**

Be careful on how you spend money.

Learn how to get an audience.

6 months research on how to build an email list.

Write guest posts on already-established blogs.

“I kept telling myself what everyone says about their own work. It’s not good enough. My ideas aren’t fully formulated. I need to get better at marketing before I put out ideas I really care about. But eventually the pain of not doing it became greater than the pain of doing it, and then finally I said to myself, ‘Dude, this is stupid, I just need to put it out there.’”

2012

- James Clear abandoned everything he have built so far, including his 20,000-person email list. He started from scratch.
- Launched [JamesClear.com](http://jamesclear.com/)

Simple strategy

- Write every Monday and Thursday
- Have a consistent publishing schedule
- Choose a pace that you can sustain
- Choose a pace slow enough that you have enough time to put together two quality articles per week-8 articles per month, 2-3 are high quality
- Approach editors of sites with much higher traffic and ask them if they were interested in reprinting his work

Visitors

- 1st Month: 780
- Next few months: 5,000-20,000
- 8th Month: 35,000-
- Now: 300,000+ per month

Email Subscribers

- Slow and steady at first
- Then steep month-by-month accumulation
- 6th month: 3,000
- 7th month: 6,000 (turning point) -> started spreading content to as many places as possible (Entrepreneur, Lifehacker, Business Insider)
- 8th month: 13,000-
- Now: 100,000

Twitter

- 67,000+ followers

Blog

- Interlinks-Sign up-Article -> Trigger link -> mini-series
- After mini-series -> paid course-Main call to action: subscribe to my email list
- Simple design, no distractions

Main Product

- Teach first course live
- Then record it for view-on-demand
- With bonus material + downloadable slides

Other Products

- Live Q&A-Speaking (1 per month)-
- Consultant

Mission first, business-second.

- The goal is to talk about stuff you care about. Not build a $10 million business.
