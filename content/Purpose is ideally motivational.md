A purpose is ideally also motivational (i.e., it inspires a person to take [[action]]). But there are purposes that do not motivate action. A purpose is motivational if it is aligned with a person's desires ([[thoughts/align purpose with a core desired mental state]]) and if the [[End state]] resulting from pursuing such purpose is rewarding for that person ([[thoughts/an action succeeds if its end state approximates its intention]]).
