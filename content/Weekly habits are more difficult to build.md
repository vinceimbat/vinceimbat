According to [[thoughts/tiago forte]], weekly habits happen frequently to be lynchpins in one's [[thoughts/life management system]] but not often enough to be natural habits like daily habits. This nature means they require more motivation and willpower to do. Thus, a [[Weekly review]] can be challenging to establish and maintain.
