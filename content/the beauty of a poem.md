Is not in the words chosen  
Or the rhythm  
Or metaphors  
Or syllables  
Or in the sounds  
Of hands applauding  
From behind the readerâ€™s eyes  

It is not even in the breath  
That flows within the poet  
As he breathes out the words  

No, we cannot see for sure  
for the beauty of a poem  
He alone sees it  
No one else can  

And it has to be that way  
For he who cannot see beauty  
by himself  
Cannot show the world
