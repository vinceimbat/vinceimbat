To [[see things as they really are]]. To let go of value and prescription.

Just being

Observing

No stand

No attachment

No ethics

Non-judgment is required for someone who practices [[amoralism]].

Non-judgment could be experienced in [[meditation]]. One could differentiate the contents of one's mind from what things really are.

[[love|Love]] is non-judgmental.

The problem with laws is that they prescribe. Law = judgment.
