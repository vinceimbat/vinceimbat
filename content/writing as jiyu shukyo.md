Writing is also continuous movement. An essay written freely is like a walk. A stance such as flights of consciousness could be used to experience jiyu shukyo in brief intervals. A larger writing practice inspired by jiyu shukyo could also involve reading a wide and diverse material, walking in the wilderness of the mind, exploring new areas and fields of thought, exploring new genres, adopting a poetics where language is used for self-liberation and liberation of others.

Are there points of convergence between jiyu shukyo and Pat Schneider's work?
