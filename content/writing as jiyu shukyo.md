Writing is also continuous movement. An essay written freely is like a walk. A stance such as flights of consciousness could be used to experience jiyu shukyo in brief intervals. A larger writing practice inspired by jiyu shukyo could also involve reading a wide and diverse material, walking in the wilderness of the mind, exploring new areas and fields of thought, exploring new genres, adopting a poetics where language is used for self-liberation and liberation of others.

Are there points of convergence between jiyu shukyo and Pat Schneider's work?

For writing to become a subsistent spiritual practice it has two do two things for me:
1. It has to help me get through with life.
2. It has to help me satisfy my need to be seen and to help others get through with life.

Writing for myself
- fragmented
- Writing as archive
- Writing as therapy

Writing for others
- requires craft
- tends to be more whole

How to use writing as a spiritual practice?
- Use it to practice faith: trust the images that come forth
- Use it to practice care: writing as archiving (taking care of the words)
- Use it to go deep within yourself
- Use it to practice faith on others

Natalie Goldberg's zen teacher once ask her, why do you need meditation if you have writing?
