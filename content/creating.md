This [[life area|life area]] involves working on crafts that I identify as integral to who I show up in the world and those that I do mainly as a hobby.

Here are the sub-areas and their standards:

# Creating - Writing

I regularly express myself through creative nonfiction (mainly vignettes), committing to mastering this form and using it to enrich my life and the lives of those around me.

# Creating - Walking

I walk regularly, deepening my use and understanding of it as a platform for philosophy, contemplation, and creativity.

# Creating - Photography

I study and practice contemplative photography regularly.

# Creating - Web Design and Development

I regularly improve my web design and development skills to improve and maintain [vinceimbat.com](http://vinceimbat.com/) and my other websites to serve as effective platforms for my creative works.

# Creating - Fantasy

I study how to write fantasy as a way to flow, have fun, and explore my philosophical ideas through story.
