AM

Sky is full of cumulus, low altitude and medium to large size. Some are turning into cumulonimbus.

Some clearance in the north but not much. Still filled with altocumulus and altostratus.

Wind is less now. Very gentle. Will probably rain this afternoon.

PM

It rained in the afternoon, more of a drizzle, so no fieldwork.

What I did was capture a few photos of plants during my morning bike ride and around the house in the afternoon while it was drizzling.

Evening 6:06 pm

Cumulunimbus covers the sky

It rained so little in the afternoon
