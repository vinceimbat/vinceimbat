While the strength of the [[talahardin]] lies in its nonhierarchical top-down design, hierarchical structures can still be very useful particularly when getting a bird's eye view of the relationships among [[evergreens]]. This is where structure notes can be helpful.

Structure notes have two main uses. First, hey can be used as an index or table of contents for the best permanent notes on a big topic. Some people online call them a map of content (MOC).

Structure notes can also serve as the end goal artifact of general projects in lieu of a manuscript or draft common in writing projects.

 [[andy matuschak|Andy Matuschak]] calls them outline notes. Andy’s advice is to [[create iterative outlines as you write notes]]. But Sascha uses the term outline notes as a special kind of structure note—one that is associated to a specific writing project (i.e., one with a goal of producing a publishable artifact).

For a guide on creating them, see [[How to create structure notes]].

# To do

- Consider integrating this to [[outline notes]] or vice versa.
