# Outline

First, define the word "God" as you will use in the essay. Emphasize that if one's idea of "God" is not the same, the arguments don't apply.

The argument for God or gods is logical.
- Fine-tuned universe
- unmoved mover
- It is popular, common, and ancient

However, if I am being honest, I can't really be 100 percent sure this is true. I can't verify it.

I value non-duplicity: telling only what I'm 100 percent know is true and avoiding half truths so as not to hurt myself and others.
- This goes back to my history of leaving the JWs. I left because I arrived at the conclusion that the Bible is not the word of God and the governing body and elders are not guided by the holy spirit.

My ability to be compassionate, loving, kind, etc. does not rely on the existence of a God.
- I am partial to the idea that there is a significant division between metaphysics and ethics.
- I would even fo far as to say that ethics itself (or the idea that there are universal, objective, nature-emerging values) doesn't exist.
- My ideas of what is good or bad depend on my personal preference. They can be different from the preference of others.
- The existence of a God means he sets value for both physics and ethics. For me, the rules I follow in actions are those I develop within my mind and heart through deliberate practice and habits.
- This translates to my position ? ? issue that seems "moralistic". Instead of relying solely on laws, rules, and punishment, we should focus on building environments where the habits necessary for the world we want to exist in could be started, maintained, or optimized.
