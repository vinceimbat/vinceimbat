I learned this idea first from [[andy matuschak]]. According to Andy, before notes become [[evergreens]], or as he likes to call them [[Evergreen notes]], they are [[Fleeting notes]]. Because most permanent notes start this way, to [[Use a note-writing system]] effectively, there has to be a mechanism to:

1. Quickly capture fleeting notes ([[Inboxes to capture fleeting notes]]).
2. Isolate them from permanent notes.
3. Store fleeting notes that need further development.
4. A practice to drain fleeting notes (see [[my note-writing practice]]).

This is what a “writing inbox” is designed to do.

As of the moment, my main writing inbox is the “Inbox” in Craft. However, I also treat my analog journals, especially the old ones, as inboxes to be drained. I process at least two journal entries a day.

Consequently, fleeting notes will indeed accumulate in the writing inbox. Although, [[A cornocupia of writing topics is a sign of a good writing workflow]], these [[Open loops]] must be closed ([[Close open loops]]).

TO DO

- Find a way to create a single reading inbox. But if it’s currently not a problem, then it is not a problem.
