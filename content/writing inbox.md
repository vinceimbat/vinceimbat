I learned this idea first from [[andy matuschak|Andy Matuschak]]. According to him, before notes become [[evergreens]], or as he calls them, evergreen notes, they are [[fleeting notes]]. Because most permanent notes start this way, to [[use a note-writing system]] effectively, there has to be a mechanism to:

1. Quickly capture fleeting notes ([[inboxes to capture fleeting notes]]).
2. Isolate them from permanent notes.
3. Store fleeting notes that need further development.
4. A practice to drain fleeting notes (see [[my note-writing practice]]).

This is what a “writing inbox” is designed to do.

As of the moment, my main writing inbox is the “Inbox” in [[obsidian|Obsidian]]. However, I also treat my analog journals, especially the old ones, as inboxes to be drained. I process at least one journal entry a day.

Consequently, fleeting notes will indeed accumulate in the writing inbox. Although, [[a cornocupia of writing topics is a sign of a good writing workflow]], these [[open loops]] must be closed ([[close open loops]]).

# To Do

- Find a way to create a single reading inbox. But if it’s currently not a problem, then it is not a problem.
