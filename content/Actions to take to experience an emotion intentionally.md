I just want to be happy and fulfilled. I didn't choose to be alive, but I am. I want to enjoy life.

Since [[To experience a particular emotion intentionally requires action]], here are four actions I think I should do to experience [[Ginhawa]] more:

1. Curate my environment (cf. [[Enhance the experience of a mental state by modifying the environment]]).
2. Perform actions that generate the emotion I desire (cf. [[Actions lead to emotions]]; [[Indirect interaction theory per Patterson]]; this also involves [[Task management]]).
3. Think thoughts that generate the emotion I desire (cf. [[Thoughts lead to emotions]]).
4. Practice presence, so that I get to catch the emotion I desire when it arises (cf. [[The only thing you can truly control is your attention]]).
