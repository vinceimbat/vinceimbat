Our beliefs about how much [[thoughts/self-reliance]] and reliance on others influence our beliefs in other areas of life. Take [[Insurance]], for example.

If we rely more on ourselves, we put factors on our hands, those that we can control (exercise, eating, sleeping, etc.) thus lessening our risk for diseases, accidents, and death. And then, we opt for a cheaper insurance plan, which means in the rare event taht something worse will happen, we use our pocket money or emergency fund plus the insurance instead of the insurance alone. One day, our assets will be enough to compensate for rare medical events.

If you rely more on others, you will be less reliant on your ability to lessen the risk. You wont be as mindful of your health and you will opt for full insurance coverage.
