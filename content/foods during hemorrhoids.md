# Foods to Eat

Your goal is to get at least 28 g of fiber each day. These foods don't have to be the only thing you eat in a day. But if they're not a regular part of your daily diet, they're a great way to help you meet that fiber goal.

High-fiber cereal

look for cereals that contain at least 5 g of fiber per serving. There are many options available in your cereal aisle like shredded wheat and high-bran cereals.

Beans
