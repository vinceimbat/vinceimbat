Every question about how to live is a question about how to act.

Every question about how to act is a subjective question.

All subjective questions require subjective answers.

Therefore, most of the answers you will need in your life will come within your subjective experience.

Therefore, the only way to truly live is to cultivate listening to the answers that come within you - through reason and emotion and intuition.

Have you listened to yourself lately?
