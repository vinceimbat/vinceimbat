Writing by itself is simply self-expression and communication. When one expresses oneself, one automatically communicates. There is nothing detrimental with expressing oneself and making a connection. These are needs and are important for our well-being.

Art and creativity are simply a vehicle, a tool, a method to fulfill a deeper need: that of knowing who one truly is and then acting, expressing, and communicating from that place. From here, questions arise:
- How can I be authentic?
- Does authenticity mean being weird, eccentric, and different?
- Does authenticity allow me to be anyone I want to be regardless of whether I hurt someone or not?

Self-expression and communication can compete for our time and attention (see [[Expressing vs. Marketing]]).
