I start walking the slightly inclined Mt. Data Street and immediately felt how this day is different than all the others that came before it. The sky is dimmer, the air colder. From afar, I saw two women get off a vehicle and enter the home of Chewy (dark brown Shitzu) and Mia (Chihuahua). The dogs live with a couple. Perhaps these are visitors.

Just pass them, I saw the sad beagle, Trixie, stand. The gate toward its cage is open and he seems either provoked or excited. He started barking. A slight joy leaped out of my heart. I realize how I was used to seeing her lie down in her cage all day. But this day is different from all the other days that came before it.

Mt. Data Street is filled with vehicles. Several turn left to Sierra Madre Street Extension. I am careful not to block the way.

On this strip of improvised roadway, a large temporary tent stands. Under it, several old men and women play cards. No one was dead. People just need to get out of their poorly ventilated homes.

I enter Raymundo Gate with a little indecisiveness on where to go next. I walk at Jose R. Velasco Avenue and follow the path around the library. When I pass by a couple sitting on the stairs, they suddenly stop talking.
