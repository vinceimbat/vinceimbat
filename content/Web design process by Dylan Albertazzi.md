## Initial meeting

- Stress the value of a high-quality website.
- Most clients are busy people and overhauling their website is a chore.
- Stress: The effort we put into our website directly affects the bottomline of the business.
- Initial meeting goals:
	- Understand the purpose of the website
	- Special needs of the website
	- What pages we need to make
	- Vibe of the website
	- Collaborate on the Hi-Five Conversion Formula
- Ask the golden question: When someone comes to your website, what do you want them to do?
	- Three uses of a website:
		- Buy
		- Schedule and appointment
		- Subscribe
- Come to the meeting prepared with three different websites of similar businesses in their space. Then let them go through what they do and don't want in the sites.
- Keep all meeting notes in a shared Google Drive with the client.

## Design

- Use Figma to create an initial design of the website.
- Only when both you and the client are in love with the mockups will you only move on to developing.

## Development

- All your client wants is an awesome website. They don't care how you get there.
- For most projects: Wix
- For custom: React and Tailwind CSS for frontend and AWS Amplify for backend
- After building, test it thoroughly.
- Demo the website to the client.
- Do necessary changes.
- Once both of you are happy, deploy.

## Payment

- Reference: Clock Work by Mike Michalowicz
- Give 15% discount if they are willing to pay upfront. Just add 15% to what you want in the beginning.
