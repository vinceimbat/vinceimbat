Yesterday, [[kiitsu kyokai]] turned to a two-hour call with Andrew, which I think I needed. We started with a 15-minute seiza. Then he told a story about the three candles symbolizing trinity and someone asking him about the Graeco-Roman pillars of the Cambridge Unitarian Church and how these objects that are part of our religious practices may or may not have religious meanings and symbolisms. Then he thought that the three bells we sound before and after seiza meditation could be a reminder of [[jiyu shukyo]]'s trinity: self, other, and cooperative society.

I would argue though that perhaps a better trinity for jiyu shukyo is self, other, and nature. Self and other makes up the cooperative society, while the cooperative society and nature make up the universal cooperative society.

Then, we went on to discuss about a member of his Church who decided to leave (?) because she doesn't want to use the words "neighbour" and "other" because they are Christian. I appreciate Andrew asking my opinion about it. He said, "Pastor to Pastor," which was very generous of him and I wouldn't deny raised my spirits.

I told him while I understand where his friend is coming from, but I also think that this attitude—our attachments to our beliefs and our attachments to our detachments to certain beliefs is the very thing that jiyu shukyo aspires for. Without this openness, change is impossible, and I think real love and radical compassion is impossible. And this is a critical position, which has to exist and be represented in our ecology of ideas. The position of positionlessness or, to be more accurate, the position of radical openness to change positions—the position to walk.

Andrew also shared what Nathan shared to him: a chapter of a book on the word jiyu—an unstranslatable word. We talked about untranslatales and how I personally prefer not to translate certain words.

I expressed my desire to engage into a spiritual practice that is diverse because the human experience—the ultimate universal truth—that allows us to relate to each other, to unite—is something that is momentarily seen, captured only briefly. These brief moments are diverse.

Now that I'm writing this, I think I now understand the desire noticeable in many religions to see the world metaphysically as one. In [[steve patterson|Steve Patterson]]'s metaphysics, it is still possible to point to an ontological oneness of self, other and non-human using relationship. If a relationship has a distinct metaphysical existence then we can still recognize the fundamental difference between mind and matter but assert their equally fundamental interdependence. This means, our freedom as individuals is still asserted, because we possess a mind that is unique, but where existence is intricately dependent and interdependent to the body it is in and the mind and bodies around it both human and non-human.

On top of them is the existence of this underlying oneness—a relationship, which is universal. How this thing that supposedly has a different ontology that I can't fully grasp could be what allows us to unite and understand each other is still something I need to figure out.

To ask
- Universalness [DONE]
- How do you study
- group chat

1,500 articles!

jiyu
- letting go of attachments

We are coming from religious communities that were dysfunctional.
- the challenge is to return to tradition without attachment: we could get useful concepts that were mis-used

verwindung
- overcome our religious traditions through incorporation.

avoid uberwindung
- you don't like this and remove it

Imaoka talks about verwindung

***

Only I can talk about me truly.
- Then we can't communicate and have no shared human experience.
- Universality: There are things that are common, intuition.
- Intuition is not oppressive.
- Universal

There is a shared thing that we will never fully understand.
- Religious life = wager or gamble that we have something we share.

We are interdependent so we can communicate.

A courage to admit that it isn't right.

How we can disagree better.

Liturgy
- form of a service
- "the work of the people"

We are different.
But also the same.
We are One.
We are human.
Interdependence.
