A note-writing application that utilizes plain text files like [[The Archive]]. It is built using Electron, which [[Andy Matuschak]] hates. Like, [[Roam]], it is primarily built for [[zettelkasten]] (i.e., bi-directional linking). It is better than [[Craft]] in this regard. It is more customizable than other leading note-taking apps. But because of this, it can also look cluttered.
