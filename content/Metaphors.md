Understanding how to use metaphors is a crucial skill in [[thoughts/poetry]]. A metaphor makes language beautiful. It doesn't make language necessarily clearer, although it does that sometimes. But it makes language more attractive and desirable.

It also distances itself from strong statements (i.e., it gives the reader freedom to interpret it the way he wants). But it does have limitations when used as a tool to uncover the truth ([[Poetry is less accurate in its description of what we know]]).

[[Poetry celebrates the present moment]]
