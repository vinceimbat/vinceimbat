When conducting a [[metalearning]] project, list [[concept]], [[facts]], and [[procedures]] in three columns to uncover the comprehensive structure of knowledge required to understand for a specific discipline. The first version of the list doesn't have to be complete or accurate. Just try to get a rough first pass. Revise the list as you start learning.

After this, [[identify bottlenecks in your learning project]].
