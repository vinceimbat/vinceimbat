Despite everything I've read, watched, and experienced, I don't (or seldom) feel any wiser. I feel like I always need advice, cannot make up my mind, and always need to contend with my feelings. But is this what wisdom means? To be always like a child, open to anything and everything. Ever humble, not quick to believe or latch into any belief. To feel free, truly free. Perhaps even indecisiveness is a sign of wisdom, at least sometimes. Or perhaps wisdom is not feeling very wise at all.
