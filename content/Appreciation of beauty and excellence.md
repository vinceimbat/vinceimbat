Some possible translations in Filipino:
- Pagpapahalaga sa kagandahan at kahusayan
- Pagdiriwang sa kagandahan at kahusayan

This is a [[VIA Character Strenghts Survey]] terminology. A related term in [[Humanistic psychology]], which I first encountered from [[Scott Barry Kaufman]] is [[Renewed freshness of appreciation]].

Appreciation seems to develop out of paying [[Attention]]. When we continuously pay attention to something, we eventually appreciate it. Subsequently, we seem to pay attention more on things that we appreciate.
