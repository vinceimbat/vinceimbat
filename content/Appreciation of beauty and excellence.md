This is a [[via character strengths survey]] terminology. A related term in [[Humanistic psychology]], which I first encountered from [[thoughts/scott barry kaufman]] is [[renewed freshness of appreciation]].

Appreciation seems to develop out of paying [[Attention]]. When we continuously pay attention to something, we eventually appreciate it. Subsequently, we seem to pay attention more on things that we appreciate.
