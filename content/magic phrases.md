# Air

- Sa gitna ng hanging halos gumagalaw
- Nakalapat ang hangin sa siwang ng bintana

# Sky

- Balat-itlog ang kinis ng langit

# Water

- I listened to the waterfall until I no longer heard it.
- I let my eyes travel from shore to shore very slowly and was amazed at the width of the water.
- And a second time I let my eyes travel over the surface, slowly, from shore to shore, beginning at my feet and ending against the precipice. There is no way like that for savouring the extent of a water surface.
