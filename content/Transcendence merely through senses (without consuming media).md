It's a fact, you feel good when you forget about yourself even for a while. But self-forgetfulness can be difficult to do by yourself. That is why you seek conversation in the company of others ([[Listening can be transcendental]]). You consume information whether audio, video, or text. You use substances.

But the most noble of all methods is what is difficult to do—to just be and use your built-in media—your senses—to devour stimuli from nature. This is done through [[thoughts/mindfulness]]. This is still forgetting oneself via devouring information and flooding the brain with it so thoughts are flushed out. But it is done naturally through senses alone and with no media, unassisted, bare bones. This state can be uncomfortable, but it puts us in direct contact with reality.

This also reminds me of [[thoughts/annie dillard]]'s views on walking with and without a camera. She calls this unscrupulous observation:

![[The two ways of seeing — Dillard#^cb1198]]

Unscrupulous because it is seeing without any preconceived bias. This state allows you to [[Develop authenticity by managing attention]].
