# Outline

Arguments
1. There is a mutually exclusive difference between a gift and a commodity. This shall be illustrated through examples in literature, history, and everyday life.
2. Art by its nature is a gift, not a commodity.
3. As artists, we need to decide for ourselves when what we are offering is a gift or a commodity.
