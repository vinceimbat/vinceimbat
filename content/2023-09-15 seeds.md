The Talahardin simply makes intentional what writers seem to intuitively believe: that all their works are never final, that even a published work cannot escape revision even if it's just in the imagination of the author, and even if the author may believe the illusion of finality, any reader could disagree. A text has a life of its own and all text especially in an age when writing technology supports and encourages constant revision, has a potential to be immortal.

Topics in Abi Nako I really like
- suicide
- contending with the need to be seen along sith one's work
- Religious and spiritual ambiguity
