Even if I am a [[Multipotentialite]], not all my interests are equally valuable to me. Some are more valuable than others by virtue of their proximity to my [[thoughts/purpose]]. This is one of the ways that [[Purpose organizes your life]]. It creates a hierarchy of interests (here is [[My current hierarchy of interests]]).

Since [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]] all my interests are organized based on their proximity to the realization of that purpose. My [[Primary interests]] helps me experience Ginhawa more directly than my [[Secondary interests]]. Secondary interests help create the ideal environments, physical states, and mental states that allow me to experience Ginhawa.
