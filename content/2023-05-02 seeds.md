- [[poems/on an afternoon walk i saw fireflies]]

Garlic vine flower buds before they bloom remind of untouched lips.

The red car parked on the right side of the road over fresh green grass is a lady in red resting.

Slow afternoon

Trike drivers waiting
Quietly
Everything and everyone is quiet
Lb is like its former self the morning before the bombing

I saw him again the tall deaf boy
Riding his bike
I envy him because he has his silence with him forever.

I walk in the middle of the road
In the middle of students dressed in the fanciest clothes
He was holding him on the shoulders as he blew me a smoky kiss
There as I walked between students

This gray car reminds me of a snake.

You have what I covet
and yet perhaps you don't know
how blessed you are

all you know is that
in their attempts to talk to you
to love you
they also can't help
but to make fun of you

The trees told me to stop saying tree shadows. They say the term is redundant. Trees, specially those deepest in the forest, no matter how enormous and intimidating, are shadows. We seldom remember them. We seldom see them.

Kapag umiikot ba ang mga alitaptap sa maliwanag na ilaw sa kalsada
nakikirta ba nila ang kanilang sarili sa salamin
O lumiliyab kaya sila panandalian
Malmang nararamdaman nila ang init
