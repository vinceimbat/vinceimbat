Sometimes, when you [[Develop photos in Lightroom Classic to share to Instagram]], you want to put a border on a carousel post ([[Develop a two-slice landscape photo for an Instagram carousel post]]). There are two ways to do this.

Border in Lightroom
1. In Lightroom Classic, choose a photo.
2. Crop the photo in 16 x 10.
3. Go to Print.
4. Under User Templates, choose the 16 x 10 template.
4. Adjust Stroke Border to achieve your desired width of the border.
6. Click "Print to file...""
7. Give a new name for the file.
5. Open the file in Photoshop.
6. In Photoshop, hold down on the Crop tool and select the Slice tool.
7. Create two slices using the slice tool.
8. Then go to File > Export > Save for Web.
9. In the Image Size section, change the height to 1350 and the width to 2160.
10. Choose either slice and change the format to JPEG then set quality to 100.
11. Do the same to the other slice.
12. Click save, be sure that "All slices" is ticked, and choose the location for your new file.

Border in Photoshop
1. In Lightroom Classic, choose a photo.
2. Crop the photo in 16 x 10.
3. Export it using the IG preset for 2 slices.
4. Open the cropped photo in Photoshop.
5. Select Crop in Photoshop.
6. Choose the 16 x 10 ratio.
7. Drag the edges of the crop to bring out a white border.
8. Hold down on the Crop tool and select the Slice tool.
9. Create two slices using the slice tool.
10. Then go to File > Export > Save for Web.
11. In the Image Size section, change the height to 1350 and the width to 2160.
12. Choose either slice and change the format to JPEG then set quality to 100.
13. Do the same to the other side.
14. Click save, be sure that "All slices" is ticked, and choose the location for your new file.

The border looks more evenly distributed in Lightroom Classic, and so I prefer the first method over the second.
