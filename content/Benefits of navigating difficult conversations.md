Navigating a difficult conversation makes me aware of three important things:

1. My emotions when confronted
2. My reactions and attitude towards adversity
3. Loopholes in my thinking

Being aware of these three things makes me a better person. They have the following effects on me:

1. When I confront the emotions, I become used to them.
2. Seeing my reactions informs whether or not I'm a peaceful coexistor.
3. Loopholes in my thinking encourage me to research more and to really dig for truth.

Learning to navigate difficult conversations make us all better people.
