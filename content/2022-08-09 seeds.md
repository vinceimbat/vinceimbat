Reality is a lot more fun than fiction. All of these being all true is what amazes me. The truth that I am here without my choice. That I share my life with all these other people who are here without their choice. The fact that this world exhibits intelligence, that it seems to have a mind of its own even if it isn't clear whether there is a persona possessing that mind. The fact that all of these creatures share a similar fate in some measure: this inner life, subective experience, consciousness. Realizing all of these, appreciating them when I used not to... this amazes me truly. And yes we could dream for more, for progress, for making things better. But, by itself, reality is actually quite awesome.

Walking in nature is great. But also is just sitting down.

Imagine all these trees communicating through electric signals sent via their roots.
