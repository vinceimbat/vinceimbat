[[thoughts/henry bugbee]] describes explanation as "a discursive affair, a roving of the mind even though not random" and "not aimless." An explanation starts from an object to be explained. The explainer then moves their attention from the object to one "discriminated factor" and another within a context.

Contextual factors create more contextual factors and so on. Every part of the context can be explained. Bugbee aptly concludes that "explanation is an endless business." When one is dedicated to explaining things, one is "committed to the life of a wanderer" who "is not permitted to rest."
