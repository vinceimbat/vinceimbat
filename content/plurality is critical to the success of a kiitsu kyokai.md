Individuals with personal and autonomous religions (i.e. [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]]) can still come together and gather into a community (or [[kiitsu kyokai|kiitsu kyokai]]). This variety is exactly what is necessary for a cooperative society to emerge. We shouldn't aspire for a community that is not plural, agrees to a single way of thinking, and penalizes divergent thinking. It is our differences with the people around us that teach us how to practice inclusivity, patience, kindness, and love.
