Thoreau has thoughts about this. He wanted A Week to have an element of being written outdoors (see Dassow Walls biography and quote it here or take from his journal). Also, he made it a point to balance reading and writing with walking.

Nietszche has ideas on the same topic:

> We do not belong to those who have ideas only among books, when stimulated by books. It is our habit to think outdoors – walking, leaping, climbing, dancing, preferably on lonely mountains or near the sea where even the trails become thoughtful. Our first questions about the value of a book, of a human being, or a musical composition are: Can they walk? Even more, can they dance?

> How quickly we guess how someone has come by his ideas; whether it was while sitting in front of his inkwell, with a pinched belly, his head bowed low over the paper – in which case we are quickly finished with his book, too! Cramped intestines betray themselves – you can bet on that – no less than closet air, closet ceilings, closet narrowness.

Books written indoors

- Written solely by reading other books.
- Overloaded with quotations, references, footnotes, explanations, refutations.
- Difficult to internalize
- Crammed with citations, annotations
- Boring
- Read slowly and with difficulty
- Written by comparing lines
- Written by repeating what others have said
- Commentary of a hundred books on a single sentence from another book

Books written outdoors

- Not overloaded with vain erudition.
- Free from the bonds of other books and the thought of others.
- Contains no explanation from anyone
- Simply expresses one’s thought, judgement, and decision.
- “Thought born out of movement”
- Thought about the thing itself—without the barriers of culture and tradition.
- Light but profound thoughts—no exegesis.
- Light thoughts rise from conviction, opinion, and established thought.
   - Gros has a point. I think what he is comparing here mainly is writing that requires references (well, you can’t write these kinds of books when you are inside a room, for sure). When you are walking, what you usually capture are your own thoughts—still thinking about others sometimes, but less attached to them, less depedent.
- The simple strategy:
   - Think while walking, walk while thinking, and let writing be but the light pause, as the body on a walk rests in contemplation of wide open spaces.

To do

- I remember here that Steve Patterson also detests using references and citations. This according to him (if my memory is correct), a midieval way of scholarship. I need to relate this to what he said. If this is how we should write and think, then this is what I need to do.

# References

Gros, F. (2014). *A Philosophy of Walking*. Verso.

> Thoreau, Emerson recalls, had made it a principle to give no more time to writing than he had to walking. To avoid the pitfalls of culture and libraries; for otherwise, what one writes is filled with the writing of others.

> Writing ought to be this: testimony to a wordless, living experience. Not the commentary on another book, not the exegesis of another text.

> Thus does the book, born out of experience, refer to that experience. Books are not to teach us how to live (that is the sad task of lesson-givers), but to make us want to live, to live *differently*: to find in ourselves the possibility of life, its principle.
