What is truer than this moment? What is more real that when we are not thinking about future moments or how we can make them a lot better than this one we currently have. How many hours in a day do we use for just being where we are—still acting but with the end of not going after something in the distant future, of future states, but just this moment.

My number one priority should be to stay here in my present mental state.

This is the reason why [[early retirement extreme]] is not for me. I can't stand five years of my life working hard. I just think that's too long and is not worth the bargain given and the rist that could happen within those five years. What I could tolerate is a day when I can both plan for the future and enjoy this moment—each moment.
