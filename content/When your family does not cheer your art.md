Keri Smith once said that one way to make yourself miserable as an artist is to expect your family to care about what you are doing.

I grew up from a family, which cared very little about the arts and scorns a life in it.

I once drew this family diagram. Everyone was in the medical field except me and a cousin who was in fashion. Even that cousin is now a nurse.

As of now, I am the only person pursuing a career in the arts seriously.

Reading Keri's words for the first time saved me from a lot of scorn.

Recently, I got in my first national writer's workshop. Although I know this means very little to my family, I did something I've never done before... share the news to my parents.

My mom seem to get what this meant to me. Although she only responded with a like button, she also checked a post and hearted it.

My father, on the other hand, simply ignored the message and sent me updates about his own life.

When I asked him why he just ignored my message, he said he said he checkedit and read it.

I laughed.

Back in the days, this would have pissed me of. But pursuing a life in the arts is already hard enough to be swayed but this.

I am sharing it here for teaching purposes.

If you are an artist, the sooner you forgive your loved ones for not caring about what you do, the easier the ride will be.

For parents with children who are showing potential in the arts... the best way to show your love to them is to support them no matter what, even if you disagree with their life choices.
