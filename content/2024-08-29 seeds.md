- [[conflict resolution]]

Daily conflicts begin with a lazy choice to react to people overstepping our boundaries through passive aggressive behavior rather than approaching them, getting to know them better, if possible establishing a form of relationship no matter how small, and airing our concern with the goal of reaching a compromise.

Look for a reference to walking in Mel Orpilla's poems then use it as a title. And then reference this title in the essay itself.

Since you are meditating about walking, it might be useful to narrate how you stumbled upon N number of words in Pangasinan that refer to walking. Put this at the Tayacdang subheading.

And then lessen the walks.

I could remove Saliasiao. Its too heavy a story and too little walking.

Lessen parts of the stories that are not related to walking.
