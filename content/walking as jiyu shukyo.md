[[Walking]] is continuous movement. Because of this, it is both metaphor and physical manifestation of [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō's]] commitment: an active faith to the unity of being that requires deep listening and openness to change.

Done intentionally, walking easily becomes a platform for observation, thought, and even some writing. By engaging in a practice like the contemporary [[derive]] that requires a radical and new way of seeing the world, walking could help one embody a sense of positionlessness, which is actually positionfulness.

Because of its nature, walking is a critical component of [[my poetics]] and my pursuit of [[my quest]].

Using walking to capture this subject involves capturing it in the perspective of a moving self that either walks in nature alone, walks across society, or walks across society in nature.

I shouldn't look at other people in just one perspective.

See walk and talk as done by [[Craig Mod]] and others.

free-religion; free, creative spirituality
that which "frees" is what "binds us together"

- a strong sense of who you are as a human
- a strong connection with the other human
- a strong connection with the unhuman

This matches the patterns Phil Smith saw in the walking arts.
- collectivism (pre-2008)
- individualism and subjectivism (post-2008)
- embodiment and the unhuman (now)
