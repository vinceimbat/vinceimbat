Walking is continuous movement. It is both a metaphor and an embodiment of jiyu shukyo. By engaging in a practice like the contemporary derive which asks you to intentionally see the world differently, walking could help you embody this sense of positionlessness or if you want positionfulness.

Walking means multiple views, grounded views. Important to cast a wider net to things we consume: read, listen to, watch.

I shouldn't look at other people in just one perspective.

See walk and talk as done by [[Craig Mod]] and others.

free-religion; free, creative spirituality
that which "frees" is what "binds us together"

- a strong sense of who you are as a human
- a strong connection with the other human
- a strong connection with the unhuman

This matches the patterns Phil Smith saw in the walking arts.
- collectivism (pre-2008)
- individualism and subjectivism (post-2008)
- embodiment and the unhuman (now)
