As children, [[thoughts/meaning]] and [[thoughts/purpose]] are not important ([[Children don’t seem to think about purpose]]). But along the way to or during adulthood, something happens to us—a death of a loved one, a transcendental experience, or an illuminating piece of art. Whether pleasant or unpleasant, the experience compels us to think about the purpose of our lives and the point of everything. As [[Sam Harris]] said, the problem of meaning and pupose only becomes a problem when it becomes a problem.
