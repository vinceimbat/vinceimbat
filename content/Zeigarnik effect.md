[[open loops]] tend to take a lot of our short-term memory and so we get distracted by them even if they are not important. This is called the Zeigarnik effect. To solve this, we need to [[close open loops]] by deleting them, doing them (if they are actionable; [[Two-minute rule]]), or deferring them, which involves writing them down in a system that we trust will remind us of them (i.e., [[Close open loops by externalizing them]]).
