1. Take time to feel upset privately.
2. Identify where you were at fault. Identify where you could have done better
3. Take ownership of it #2. Do this so you don't bring it to the next job.
4. Identify what was not your fault.
5. Then let #4 go.
6. Reaffirm who you are. Identify where you are good at.

I can bring value in this area.
Maybe I messed up even in my best area but I am going to make it better.
