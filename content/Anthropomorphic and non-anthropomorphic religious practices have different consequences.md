Practices that do and do not involve interacting with person-like beings are startkly different. In the former, practitioners expect that they are heard. In the latter, practitioners act in accordance to the order of things. That said, both forms of practices can be placed in the same category because [[Both anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic religious practices involve the supernatural]].

> there is a marked difference between practices that do and practices that do not involve interacting with person-like beings. In the former, anthropomorphic cases, practitioners can ask for help, make offerings, and pray with an understanding that they are heard. In the latter, non-anthropomorphic cases, practitioners instead typically engage in actions that put themselves “in accord with” the order of things.
