12:00 am, January 1, 2025. The first fireworks have flown and erupt above Mayondon. They are joined by the blowing of horns of motorcyclists running around the subdivision. I'm holding Lea in my arms while watching all these on the balcony. Surrounding us, witnessing this welcoming of another new year, are some of our closest friends and loved ones. As we enjoy this play of lights and sounds in each other's company, my mind couldn't help but walk down what has transpired in my life for the past twelve months.

Earlier in 2024, I wrote the following intention:

>This 2024, my main intention is to do everything necessary to find and listen to my most authentic voice and to use it in writing my story and truth. A secondary intention would be to cut unnecessary goals and to focus on the most authentic, exciting, and life-changing ones.

Little did I knew when I wrote those words that this commitment to be my most authentic self and focus only to things that bring that authenticity to life would lead me to my best year yet.

Committed to finding authenticity in my writing, I devoted a significant amount of time in studying Pat Schneider's work, particularly the first part of her book Writing Alone and With Others. This study led me to other methods that furthered my goal. It helped me identify writers whose voice and work are closest to the kind of voice and writing I wanted to cultivate. Using this self-knowledge, I was able to write, get the right feedback, and rewrite the vignettes that make up the manuscript of my book about Los Baños. The manuscript is ready and I'm now in the process of looking for options to print and self-publish it.

Aside from well-written, authentic vignettes, the book about Los Baños is also filled with beautiful pieces of my photography. I am proud of how deep my photography practice have reached this year, and with this, I thank Louise Far. Through working closely with her I was able to create a customized learning path to follow in deepening my contemplative photography practice. This path allowed me to identify the most important skills to focus on, the tools to invest in and master, and the projects to work on to express my most authentic photographic voice.

The first writing and photography project where I used Pat's and Louise's influence in my work was my first week-long walk of Baguio City. In that walk, I let the roads trigger memories that allow me to confront my past spiritual life as a JW minister. I found my courage to do this because I have started to deepen into my free, creative, subsistent spirituality through the help of Andrew James Brown and my also deepening seiza practice with Miki Nakura. This spirituality has allowed me to pursue authenticity along with a close 

With the confidence I gained from working with Louise and Andrew and studying Pat's work, my use of the walking method has only deepened. I have studied the literature more this year and I'm now quite confident in the techniques and strategies in my disposal when doing a creative walking project. With all these knowledge and experience, I was able to do a second week-long walk of Los Baños as well as a purely exploratory walk in a space outside my comfort zone.

I was tugged to the present moment by Lea's tightening hug. I could feel that she is really happy. Finally, we were able to host a New Year's Eve with friends because we invested money, time, and effort in transforming our simple abode into a place that inspires us to live our best life every day and to welcome the most important people in our lives. This house has become a community space where Lea and I host friends at least twice a month over good food and cheerful camaraderie. Having this space has brought us closer to each other and the people who make us happy.

There is a feeling of safety and contentment not only in this space that shelter us but in this life that we have carefully curated for ourselves. Lea and I are making enough consistent money to live a comfortable simple life that supports our creative and entrepreneurial projects. This year, I helped Lea design a life and career that matches her strengths and deepest desires. We both were able to register as non-licensed professionals on BIR and both of us have multiple sources of income, which make financially resilient.

As Lea and I welcome 2025 with a company of friends and people we love, I silently say gassho to the universe, the world, and the mystery that have brought me, Lea, these people, and all these events in our shared lives in 2024 and which will continue to lead us to our most authentic selves in the years to come.
