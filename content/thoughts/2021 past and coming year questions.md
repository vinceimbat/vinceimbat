# Past Year

## List your 3 top wins for the year.

1. Living independently in Los Baños, and slowly creating my new life.
2. Making a huge progress in terms of how I think about and do my work. I was able to articulate my five categories of actions in my life work, which continue to direct how I plan what to do: Studying, Living, Sharing, Connecting, and Facilitating.
3. Being really close to Lea and closer to her family.

## What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned in the past year?

1. Simply exposing myself around creative people doing meaningful work inspires me to do the same.
2. Using kind words even to people who are being mean usually leads to good things.
3. One’s creative life is not about the milestones but about the people and the moments that one’s work is able to help those people.
4. It is important to put a deadline to projects. Doing so make them less intimidating and boosts once confidence to finish.
5. I want to do comtemplative work—practice savoring and nurturing the children of my mind.
6. Fulfillment in life depends on how good one can control one’s attention.
7. I should never make a big purchase in places where I don’t have that much protection after the sale.
8. We seek justice not to avenge a wrong but to help the wrong to not be repeated.
9. I can continue to build a life of my own, away from my family, without necessarily totally disconnecting with them, nor do I want to do that. Mama and Papa are growing old each year. It’s time to give back.
10. I could improve my financial life just by using digital banks and investing.
11. I learned how to make sense of my sexual preferences, honor them, and articulate them to my partner.
12. When solving a particular problem, choose the least invasive solution or tool that will have lesser side effects and have just enough features before exploring more invasive solutions or more robust tools.
13. Buy products that can be repaired and last longer.
14. How I review my work is closely connected to how I share.

## What were the risks you took?

1. I moved to Los Baños in the middle of the pandemic almost abruptly.
2. I continued to stay unvaccinated.
3. I explored my sexuality.

## What was your most loving service?

Adopting two stray cats.

## What is your unfinished business from the past year?

Continue to articulate and explore my preferences for my life work.

## What are you most happy about completing?

I achieved my goal of accumulating at least 100 quality notes in my Talahardin.

## Who were the three people that had the greatest impact on your life this year?

1. Andy Matuschak - How I think and cultivate the children of my thoughts
2. Craig Mod - My walks (and how I savor the world in general) have been deeper because of him.
3. Lea - I feel less alone because of her. I can imagine a brighter future because of her. I feel accepted and contented because of her. I can take risks in other areas of my life because I am stable with her.

## What was your biggest surprise?

When I arrived here in LB last January, I was surprised about how little I know about really living a creative life. I met Maui and understood more of her processes. I met Gian and learned about his artistic struggles. I got to know Diwa more and her interest in curation. Through this experience, I was inspired about the possibility of me living a creative life by simply surrounding myself with creative people. This set the trajectory for my entire year.

## What compliment would you liked to have received? Given?

I would like to have been complimented that the work I do behind doors is beautiful (walking and writing notes). The closest compliment I had with this was Ate Peachy noticing that I do walk daily, and Maui saying she is encouraged by my dedication in journaling.

There is no compliment I would like to have given. I think I have been very generous in complimenting Lea. And I complimented my friends when I saw it apt.

# What else do you need to do or say to be complete with this year?

My year is complete without having to do or say anything.

## What one word or phrase best sums up and describes your experience this year?

Walking into a new life

## What stories from last year are you letting go of?

1. I am letting go of the story that the iPhone 11 Pro experience has not been closed. It is closed. I could reopen it if I want to, but that is only optional. It is done. The phone has done wonders in terms of my photography. I have learned resilience through the experience. I have had first-hand experience with working with government agencies. How would I every learn about these things without going through this experience? I love my faith. I could opt to pursuing justice more and learning more. But I am not sure that is a priority right now.
2. I am letting go of the story that I didn’t go home in time to see Doji one last time. I am letting go of all the guilt that I may have felt during that time. I have done my best for Doji when he was alive based on what I know at that time. I will always love him.
3. I am letting go of the story that I have to totally disconnect from my parents and Pangasinan so I can build an ideal life. I can continue to see them even as I build my own life. In fact, there is no better time to do that than right now, while I am still less busy and I still don’t have my own family.
4. I am letting go of the story that I have to compromise my values and preferences just to feel like I belong in a certain group. I will never go back to communities I no longer resonate with. I will continue to assert my preferences in my circle of friends.
