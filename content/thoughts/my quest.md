## Metaphor

I am an existent who ultimately doesn't know where he came from. I came to a space that is foreign. I didn't choose to be here. This space can be tough. There is one way out: death. And yet I chose to live. In this space, I take a walk slowly to understand where I am and try to live with curiosity. First, I do it only to survive, but I realize I am capable of more than that. I walk to learn the geography because I can attend to other existents who occupy the same space. I can attend in some way that I create happiness and meaning, things that are not innately in the space, things that only I, the being with the mind, could provide. The space is meaningless and I have the capacity to bring meaning to it. It is as if I was chosen to do this very work.

## Explanation

My quest is articulated here as fiction, but really is a metaphor. It is made up of two things:
1. An articulation of my picture of reality (i.e., [[thoughts/metaphysics]] and [[thoughts/epistemology]])
2. An articulation of how I respond to this reality (i.e., [[thoughts/ethics]], [[thoughts/praxeology]], and [[thoughts/poetics]])

In short, my quest is heavily inspired by [[thoughts/my worldview]]. Since my worldview could grow and change in time, so will my quest.

The beliefs about reality within my worldview that is most relevant to my quest are as follows:
1. [[we did not choose to exist]].
2. [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless]].
3. [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]].
4. Believing on a God can be convenient, but [[God does not exist]].
5. Since God does not exist and [[thoughts/there is no single purpose everyone must follow]], I am left to DIY how to live.

The beliefs about responding to reality within my worldview most relevant to my quest are as follows:
1. The formula for living is simply this: [[To live well simply means to set your own intentions and live according to them]].
2. [[To live intentionally requires adequate self-knowledge]].
3. [[thoughts/knowledge is necessary to fulfill intentions]].
4. When transitioning from unintentional to [Intentional living]], you need to know enough about what you want and how you are going to get what you want. The former requires self-knowledge. The latter requires knowledge about the world.
5. A part of my DIY how to live project is ensuring that I am free of pain and happy as much as possible ([[thoughts/happiness]]).
6. But then, I realize that [[Happiness is not the ultimate value]], and that I also need [[thoughts/meaning]].
7. These arguments led me to a simple articulation of my purpose: "[[my purpose is to live deliberately]]."

My worldview and quest defines [[thoughts/my poetics]].
