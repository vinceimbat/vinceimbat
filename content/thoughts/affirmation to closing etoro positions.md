Closing those positions means you changed your strategy so that your portfolio can be saved and you can recuperate.

The alternative was to stick to the plan (which was not working). That was a weaker move. Changing the plan is the right thing to do.

You lost around USD 1,500, which is around 80,000. You currently have USD 3000 alive and are copying traders who could help you recoup that amount in one year.

You learned valuable lessons on investing from this experience and that is what's most important.

Another way to look at it: from 2012 to 2019 (and some parts of 2020), you lived basically for free. That's the majority of your 20s. That 80k that you lost is like money you gave back to the world to repay all the gift you received. The only regret is that money could've been given to your parents instead.

It's just a three months worth of expenses.
