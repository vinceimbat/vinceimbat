How I encountered Brown.
- August 2022: Reading about Henry Thoreau -> Discovered Edward Mooney (studying how to write philosophical content but with a beautiful artistic style) -> Henry Bugbee -> Andrew J. Brown (through his article "Henry Bugbee: An Atheistic Mysticism Free of Mythological Trappings")
- I was really surprises you were a minister and an atheist
- Read [[essays/uman 2022-08|uman 2022-08]] to show him how you encountered him.
- I know you from a far for more than a year but never felt the urge to reach out until about two months ago. Why? (The recent trip to Baguio)

- CREED: I notice that the Creed of Life copy in your website does not match that in George Williams' book. Is the one in your website an updated version?
- FAITH: I've always struggled with the word "faith." Since leaving the JW, it's a word I stopped using. But when I started confronting my past last year, it is a word I'm beginning to reintegrate into my vocabulary. How did Imaoka use this word faith (shinzuru)?
	- You told me "the most important thing is always to keep listening with an as open-mind and open-heart as possible...to what's going on in our own head and heart/body." Is this what "faith" means? Remaining open?
- What does having faith in oneself look like?
	- Witnessing the coming and going of my thoughts and emotions without judgment?
- "step forward" = faith; not believe; 
- shinjin: true entrusting
- true entrusting
- skillful means
- John Shelenburg:
	- Prairie Schooners: only way to find out if it's true is to try
	- "Risk" - 
	- minimalist religion; religions are too thick sometimes
- FREEDOM: How did Imaoka ultimately understood freedom in his "free religion concept?"
	- He was heavily influenced by Henri Bergson who said moments of freedom is so hard to come by because we always live in a superficial self.
	- Did this match the word "jiyu" or did it have a different meaning in Imaoka's thoughts?
- How did Imaoka reconciled an individual's search for freedom with his interdependence with others?
- CHURCH: Among all the statements in Imaoka's creed, statements 6 and 7 are the ones I found so hard to reflect on. Unlike the other statements, I couldn't apply these two.
	- Could you imagine a case where one practices free religion without being part of a religion or church? If so, how would that look like?
- Really clear
	- Church = community spaces where we get teachings
	- You need to make your own kyokai (he can't practice that in other places). It doesn't matter if there is no two or three of you.
- JOINING A CHURCH: What I really want about statement 6 is that church is viewed as a practice ground for a cooperative society. That helped me really understand the practical necessity of a church. So I may not be emotionally ready for it, but intellectually, I see the wisdom in joining one. But also in being cautious about what to join. Because if it is a practice ground for the ideal society, I should ask myself first what that ideal society is.
	- Do you have any advice you can give me when I ever reach that point where I am ready to try things out and associate with a church?
- You mentioned in some of your writings this idea of a "minimalist religions." How does that tie well with free religion?

- How has your church responded to your gentle nudges in encouraging them to adopt these creed of life?
- Are there anything from Imaoka's views that you disagreed with?

- Imaoka wrote this about Emerson, "my great teacher of free religion, I feel a great responsibility in accepting his spiritual legacy." Is accurate to say that Imaoka's free religion is linked with transcendentalism? If so, how strong of a link is there?
	- Even before I met you and Imaoka, I've been a fan of Thoreau.
	- After leaving my past religious life, I got deep into writing. I wrote for others but primarily for myself. I now see it as an expression of my spirituality.
	- Transcendentalism, as you know, is heavy with literature, and that is why it appeals to me. Learning more about this link between free religion and transcendentalism might help me, I thought.






- I am considering options of expressing my spirituality.
- I would like to facilitate writing sessions that help people experience this free, creative spirituality. Do you know any examples I could check and try to emulate, specifically within free religion or
- Right now, I am reading Literary Transcendentalism and studying the methods of the transcendentalists, but I'm curious whether a more contemporary group or individuals are exploring this connection between art  (specifically writing) and free religion
