[[thoughts/praxeology|Praxeology]] could not explain what ends you will choose and why you will choose them because such requires a subjective answer. It is a question of [[thoughts/purpose|purpose]]. My reasons for doing something could be articulated but others cannot be articulated as they are beyond reason, i.e., inclinations and tendencies. The reasons that could be articulated can be explained through [[thoughts/psychology|psychology]].
