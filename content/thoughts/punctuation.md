Three most important grammatical units to identify when punctuating. :: independent clauses, dependent clauses, and phrases

Subject ::: doer or receiver of a verb's action or state

Finite verb ::: a verb form marked to show its particular grammatical function

A finite verb is not a ?? (to be, to go, to walk), a ?? (being, going, walking), or a ?? (been, gone, walked). :: infinitive, present participle, past participle

Clause ::: group of related words that includes both a subject and a finite verb.

Independent clause ::: clause that can stand alone as a complete sentence

Dependent clause ::: clause that cannot stand alone as a complete sentence

Phrase ::: a group of related words that does not contain both a subject and a finite verb
