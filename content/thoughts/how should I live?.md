This is an "ethical" question (i.e., a question about how one ought to act based on justifications that represent one's beliefs on what is right or wrong). It is different from the question [[thoughts/how to live]] It presupposes that there is a certain way that one “must” live.

When you ask this question, you are interested about uncovering or even building a process, system, or practice that you presecribe to yourself. This system inspires [[thoughts/action]] and provides justification for them.

The first step in answering this question is to know what you are looking for. To find this, you need to find a way to know what you are looking for ([[thoughts/philosophy]]). Discovering what you are looking for involves asking yourself how you know what you know ([[thoughts/epistemology]]) and what exists ([[thoughts/metaphysics]]).

Here are some thoughts that represent [[My answer to how should I live]].

To do

- Use Blackwell’s “How to Live: A Life of Montaigne” to describe the difference of the two more.
- Go to each backlink and determine if what is better linked is How to live or How should I live
