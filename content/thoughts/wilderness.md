The wilderness is what I use to describe the state of being "unexplored" (or "currently being explored") of a few things.

1. I use it to refer to the unexplored life that newborns are thrown into.
2. I use it to refer to [[thoughts/geographical wilderness|geographical wilderness]], unexplored physical space in general, and specifically those I haven't walked on yet, places I don't have an intimate relationship with.
3. I use it to refer to [[thoughts/mental wilderness|mental wilderness]], unexplored ideas, concepts, thoughts, experiences, images, and other contents of the mind.

I was inspired by how [[thoughts/henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee]] used it.

To do
- Write a note about Henry Bugbee's conceptualization of wilderness.
- Write a note about Thoreau's idea of wilderness.
