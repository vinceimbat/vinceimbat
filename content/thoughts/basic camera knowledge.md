# Set primary settings

- Set your default auto focus mode to "One Shot" or "Single Shot."
- Set your metering mode to "Evaluative."

# Begin in Program (P) Mode

As a beginner, concentrate on composition (sharpening your eye). Just use Program (P) mode for now.

Set ISO first.
- 100 for good outdoor light
- 200 or 400 for lower lighting conditions
- 800 or higher for dim conditions or action

Practice composition.
Use exposure compensation if necessary.

# Graduate to Aperture Priority (AV) Mode

Be in Aperture Priority mode.

Set ISO first.
- 400 on overcast day
- If darker, increase.

Set aperture depending on the need.
- small f-number = small area of focus; big f-number = big area of focus.

Let the camera adjust shutter speed.
- Dark = slow shutter speed
- Bright = fast shutter speed
- Slow shutter speed = blur
- To freeze movement, choose 1/125 or faster
