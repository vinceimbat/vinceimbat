I have forgotten where kuya pete and ed lived here.
Ate sheba was also from here. Inside an eskinits.

Vacant lot around where kya ed's house may have been.

A grandpa kisses a child with down syndrome in front of his neighbors. He does so repeatedly as if to say hey i love him with all my heart no matter who he is.

This is the route I took the day we broke things off, the day before the symptoms started. I think it was a Monday morning after we slept over at the sister.

A walk i hve almost no memory of

A walk i am doing as if for the first time

Houses i do not remember

Unfamiliar walls

Turns i may or may not passed through

Oh yes of course another turn

A thoughtless, imageless, memory/less walk

And yet as I near the house I can feel the things I once felt

On bayan park, leaves of the lone bamboo greet me with the wind

A walk not taken for a long time becomes long

Memory: saw brother villanueva's house. A women white haired sits on the stairs behind the gate, watching a magazine stand. Preaching. Motionlessly.

Memory of role play

Mais vendor arrives and people come out if their homes.

Walking at Leonilla Hill i realized hey there are lots of areas of Baguio unexplored by this feet. Wildernesses with no memories saved. These are new terrains. Blank canvasses to be painted. New places where I could explore something new.
