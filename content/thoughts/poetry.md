Poetry is about being as intentional as one can be with one's words. Being economical. Minimalistic. About how one can transmit meaning with as little tools as one can.

I think all writers ought to be poets or at least try to be one.

Essays on the other hand are where we try. Where we can be more free.

Genreless writing is of course not concerned about these genres. It is about freedom.
