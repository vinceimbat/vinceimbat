This problem is closely related to defining what my field is ([[My field is practical philosophy]]).

As Andy Matuschak said, anything we call ourselves is simply a short-hand to what we truly value. Nevertheless, a title is a useful signal that have practical uses (one of which is navigating questions about oneâ€™s work while in gatherings).

Since I am a generalist, I need to use titles that a generalist can use.

Examples:

- Independent researcher
- Writer
