# My Home and Environment

I am still living in Santa Maria, waiting for the pandemic to die so that I could move nearer to Lea. I live independently and I have learned how to ~~manage a house by myself: cleaning, buying groceries, going to market, cooking.~~ **I have done my best to turn our simple house into a place that is more comfortable and supports my true self more.** I will be leaving this house knowing that I have made it a better place.

# My Routine

~~I wake up at around 7 AM every day.~~ When I wake up, I clean my bed then ~~I spend about 5-10 minutes just bonding and playing with Doji and Chikako.~~ I make sure that they get this time every day so they could feel loved. It also helps stimulate them as they’re already growing old and are just sleeping the whole day. Having this playtime every morning is good for their mental health.

After playing with them, I go downstairs, switch on the internet, throw the bed pan, and wash my face. I then go upstairs and weigh in. After this, I go back downstairs, drink two glasses of water, and immediately start preparing oats for breakfast. I usually sit down to eat by 8 am.

While eating, I start reading Thoreau’s journal then a few pages from whatever book or article I am currently reading.

After eating, I write the morning entry of my five-minute journal: I journal about what I am most grateful for from the past day, I identify my top three most important tasks, and then write an affirmation for the day.

After writing on my five-minute journal, I free write on my diary for at least five minutes, focusing on expressing my inner thoughts and feelings and the current state of my mind. Some days I just free write, other days I review several ideas I was exploring the past day.

After journaling, I do sitting meditation for about 10-15 minutes.

If there is something I really love from Thoreau’s entries that I think is worth translating, I fire up my computer and translate that. I then look for a photo that matches the translation from my collection of photos. I share my photo + translation on IG and Facebook.

If I still feel like creating stuff, I could draw or make a blackout poem.

::I then share something on the blog. I look for any past work that is finished or partially done, which I can complete and share.::

Ride bike to Sitio Daligan for 30 minutes.

This marks the end of my morning routine.

In the afternoon, I focus on doing admin tasks, consuming and exploring art, recreation, and connecting with my community.

# My Life System

~~I have established a minimum viable life system, which allows me to manage my actions so that what I do is connected to what I want to feel and experience.~~ **I have written a text that introduces the theories and concepts that form the foundation of my system, which I could update anytime I improve my understanding. (?)**

~~I am effectively using a note-taking app, a task manager, a calendar, a read-later app, digital inboxes (email, desktop, downloads, etc.), a PARA system, and a backup system. I also have a paper filing system. I have written a text containing a list of my core desired mental states, core values, purpose, mission statement, best future self, and character strengths.~~

~~I have a text detailing how I will conduct a Weekly Review, Monthly Review, and Annual Review.~~ At the beginning of the year, I write a gratitude list, answer questions about the past and coming year, write a new personal narrative vision for the coming year, and add goals for projects and standards for areas of responsibility. Every month, I review my personal narrative vision and update my goals and standards. ~~I have calendar reminders for when I will conduct each of these reviews.~~

~~I have a written process on how to plan, execute, and manage projects.~~

**I have written a short but expandable description of why I do what I do based on what I know about the world, human behavior, and myself. This is my minimum viable life philosophy, which helps me and other people understand my life. (?)**

**I have also written a minimum viable life manual - an operating procedures containing clear instructions on how to use and maintain my system, which helps me use the system efficiently and also help others understand how to create a similar system. (?)**

# My Physical Health

~~I have a comprehensive plan for curing my Globus sensation and LPR and I am following the plan until the sensation is gone.~~

::I sleep before 12 MN every night, so I get a good 7 hours of sleep every night.:: I wake up feeling well-rested, energized, sharp, and kind, ready to take on the demands of the day. I have identified what kind of diet I will invest into. ~~I have identified what kind of physical activity I will invest into and how much time per week I will put into it.~~

# My Mental Health

~~I have understood how to manage my tinnitus enough to prevent it from getting worse and to manage my reaction to it better.~~ I have prevented my tinnitus from getting worse. I have managed my reaction to it well so that it doesn’t bother me most of the time.

# Relationships

My relationship with Lea has been really thriving despite being separated from her due to the quarantines. ~~I make sure that my evening calls with her are useful, loving, and fun.~~ **I have collaborated with her on a project that keeps us connected even from afar.**

~~With my support, Lea has started to build her own life system.~~ She is thriving in her freelancing career, making more than half of her monthly income from email copywriting. She has enough savings in the bank to support her for six months of no work. ~~She has also started to explore the foundations of the lifestyle business she wants to build for herself. On the side, she continues to explore her hobby of reading books and watching fun films and television series.~~ She is closer to her siblings more than ever and asserts her needs lovingly at home, teaching her siblings emotional intelligence through her example. Her relationship with her mom has drastically improved. ~~She is able to be more patient with the people around her. She has strong ties with her tribes.~~ She has even started a community of her own. ~~Overall, she is way happier than when I first met her.~~

::I call Ate Mau’s family at least once a month on Zoom for a dinner date. I call my cousins abroad at least once a month to maintain my bond with them.::

~~I have started to nurture relationships with at least four friends, whom I check-in every week to provide support to whatever they are doing.~~ **I have started building an ideal community.**

::I have peaceful relationships with all my neighbors. I do not express my problems in an antagonistic manner. I let go of small things. If there are major things that need to be addressed, I do so by talking to them directly in a peaceful and nonviolent way.::

# Sustenance

**I have established a plan for my finances and material life.** ~~I have established a sustainable monthly earning routine through Scribendi in a way that allows me to earn 40k per month but does not compromise my health.~~ **I have accomplished all the Scribendi courses. (?)**

**I have understood how to decide and manage health insurances.**

# Art

::I continue to translate my favorite entries in Thoreau’s journal.::

~~I have determined what to do with all the nature videos I have taken since 2018.~~

~~I have created a workshop about the creative process of Thoreau.~~

~~I have reviewed my life work design and modified it to make my creative life more enjoyable.~~

**I have created a philosophical podcast in Filipino. (?)**

::I have created a list of bike trails to explore::.

~~I have gathered testimonials and feedback about my writing.~~
