The goal of this spiritual and religious life is to be able to have faith (which is to say, to be able to listen) as much as possible to what is really in my depth.

I couldn't disagree: while I may be a mutually exclusive unique person, I am a multilayered self and my innermost self seems to be easily hidden. What can I do to unhide it?
