[[thoughts/understanding mainly informs action|Understanding mainly informs action]]. I do not try to understand to decorate myself or to win arguments. I try to understand to develop wisdom, feel good, and always act appropriately.

Understanding is the core of my life. I am a philosopher first before a writer or anything else. I am committed in living a philosophical and contemplative life and write beautifully about or inspired by this journey.

There are two works involved in understanding:

1. **Sharpening my understanding.** This involves cultivating [[thoughts/mindfulness|mindfulness]], comprehensive research, deep reading, careful thinking, and mental sharpness, so that I can [[thoughts/see things as they really are|see things as they really are]] (i.e., apply a [[thoughts/scout mindset|scout mindset]]).
2. **Using my understanding.** This involves applying my understanding in various situations and subjects.

The main question I try to study is: [[thoughts/how should I live?|how should I live?]]

A concise answer to this question is my purpose: [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately|my purpose is to live deliberately]]

Since [[thoughts/life is a project|life is a project]] made up of individual actions, answering the question “How should I live?” involves understanding what [[thoughts/action|action]] is. To understand what action is, I also need to understand the context where it is initially intended (the [[thoughts/mind|mind]]) and the context where it is manifested (the physical universe).

Once I understand action, I can move on to studying a more specific way of acting or living: [[thoughts/intentional living|intentional living]]. Intentional living is how I fulfill my purpose. Through intentional living, I can align my actions with my purpose, which are informed by an understanding of my [[thoughts/true self|true self]].

I can achieve this alignment by following [[thoughts/the core process of intentional living|the core process of intentional living]], which requires three levels of understanding:

1. An understanding of my true self
2. An understanding of how I can identify and set my intentions
3. An understanding of how I can act in alignment with my intentions

These levels of understanding are all jump-off points to other intellectual disciplines and other practices.

In the Philippines, these three levels are usually explored in academic psychology circles, Eastern spirituality circles, and Christian circles. However, [[thoughts/we need a non-academic and non-sectarian discourse in intentional living|we need a non-academic and non-sectarian discourse in intentional living]].

I study a lot of different subjects and here is [[thoughts/my studying process|my studying process]].

# Areas

The [[thoughts/life area|life areas]] under understanding are the following:

## Understanding - LMS Theory

## Understanding - Forest Garden

## Understanding - Worldview

My worldview contains how I see the world ([[thoughts/epistemology|epistemology]], [[thoughts/metaphysics|metaphysics]]), how I act ([[thoughts/ethics|ethics]]), and how I create ([[thoughts/poetics|poetics]])

# To do

- Make a separate note on the three levels of understanding.
