I reach out to my scenius every day as part of [[my daily routine]]. I do this in the afternoon after [[my note-writing practice]] in the morning. At the start, I should do audience research according to the advice of [[thoughts/dan blank]]. Once I start being connected with ideal followers in social media, I could start sharing my processes on social media.

NOTE: Update this entire note using Dan Blank’s principles in engaging an audience.

The following is the process and principles I follow when [[thoughts/connecting]]:

1. I will put up a system for connecting.
   - I will be using social media to connect with people. I will pe picking just one. The platform should be something that me and my audience enjoy using.
   - These social media efforts are designed to get everyone into my email list.
1. I will pursue reaching out as a daily habit embedded in [[my daily routine]].
2. I will look for influencers I resonate with, reach out to them and build a relationship with them.
3. I will check who they are interacting with in their comments.
4. I will reach out to people in their audience I resonate with and start conversing with them.
5. I will do one-on-one interactions first until I have exhausted myself. I will do this mostly online, but if there are in-person opportunities to connect, I will take advantage of them too.
6. My intention in connecting will simply be to express sincere interest in what my possible mentors, peers, and fans are doing. I will not share ANY LINKS in the first opportunity.
7. I will offer help and be generous if there are opportunities to do so.
8. I’ll start by joining in the conversations in comments, then do DMs in the future.
9. Build rapport by interacting with the same person (7-20 times). Once rapport is built, I can then share a link to my work if it is appropriate.
