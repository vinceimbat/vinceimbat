To write a new personal narrative vision, follow these steps:

1. Read last yearâ€™s PNV and find some inspiration. Note any unachieved ideas that you might want to carry over to the new year.
2. Refer to the [[thoughts/past and coming year questions|past and coming year questions]], [[thoughts/life goals|life goals]], and [[thoughts/life area|life areas]] and write a present-tense description of what the last day of the present year would look like.
