Work is [[thoughts/action|action]]. It is everything I do to fill up this one life. Work should ultimately provide one's life with meaning. As I see it, work can either be a form of livelihood or a [[vocation]]. Livelihood provides sustenance to oneself to continue living, so it has to generate money or material needs. On the other hand, vocation does not always make money, but it is always an important work. [[thoughts/some important work are necessary even if unprofitable|Some important work are necessary even if unprofitable]].

Every human being should be able to pursue their vocation freely to self-actualize and truly contribute to others, especially those who most need their gifts and talents. Sometimes, one's livelihood is also one's vocation. But often, one's vocation doesn't generate money. In this case, it is necessary to keep a livelihood, such as a day job, that provides sustenance to one as one pursues one's vocation. It is helpful to pursue voluntary simplicity so one doesn't have to spend a lot of time for livelihood, time better spent for one's vocation.

That said, all work can provide meaning and satisfaction when approached with quality of action. Work is one's way to continue the flow of the gift in society. Our strengths and talents are gifts. It is only appropriate to make the best use of them and offer the world, especially to those who need it the most, our truest most genuine self.
