In my journal, I reflected on the freelancers' event that Lea and I attended yesterday. I wrote that it felt good to speak my truth. I told the group that I had been a freelancer since 2014. I said I freelanced because the things I wanted to do didn't necessarily make money (and I might now want them to make money anyway), but I needed to spend more time on them (and a flexible schedule to do so). I told them I was a poet, writer, and photographer who loved to walk. Sharing all of that with a group that sincerely listened, was respectful, and supportive all throughout felt really good.
