Don't change what isn't broken. If something is working for u right now introduce a change conservatively

Simplify

Be minimalist

Focus on wht is most important

Now u experienced really strong emotions, you know uhave a lot of work to do.

Will doing more writing really help u?

What should be ur top priority?

Books
1. Naglalakad ng Nakapikit
2. Walking 

Write something that celebrates
- the reality that we are here and not other else. That what constitutes "we" at any given time is a product of millions of miracles.

The book has to be braided.
