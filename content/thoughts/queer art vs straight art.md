Notes from Butiki Baboy

Queer art vs not queer

Queer
- streams of consciousness, playful (problematic because some straight people do so)
- more experimental
- Andaming pinanggalingan vs straight na medyo careless and walang pake sa reception

Straight
- like orgasm yung text

The need to categorize is weird because we dont categorize straight art as straight. But labels do help for marketing. But labels are unnecessary.
