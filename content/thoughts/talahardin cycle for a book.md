Assuming that you have chosen a good book, you can apply the [[thoughts/my studying process]] to produce two kinds of artifacts:
1. [[thoughts/evergreens]]
2. Product-oriented notes like [[Structure notes]], [[Outline notes]], or drafts.

To arrive at these artifacts, follow the following steps:
1. Read the text while highlighting anything that is useful. Be very selective with your highlights.
2. Extract your highlights and put these in a note in [[Zotero]].
3. Create a new note and process your highlights into [[literature notes]].
4. Convert literature notes to permanent notes ([[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]]).
5. Use permanent notes to write structure notes, outline notes, and drafts.
