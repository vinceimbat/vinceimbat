The central question that metaphysis sets to answer is “What exists?”

This is [[My metaphysical position]].

***
2 mutually exclusive perspectives

1. One universe, we carve out categories
2. Multiple particles, we build categories out of them

What fundamentally exists are a bunch of fundamental units

- Time
- Space
- Etc.

When you combine them they become

- Atoms

When you combine atoms you create entities (its your mind creating these)

- These are simply lumps of entities at a particular state.
- You can list these entities

Doesnt mean that some boundaries are conceptual is that all boundaries are conceptual

Mental phenomena is more fundamental.

Physical experience is conceptual. It is a way to explain our mental experience.

Problem of property

- Property is just the uniqueness of my visual field
