- [[thoughts/faith generates contentment]]

Ever since I've started responding to the check up on my meditation timer, I seldom clicked content. I reason that there are things that remain unresolved in my life, I shouldn't feel contentment.

But reflecting on Bugbee makes me want to challenge this. I could find contentment on every moment no matter what the situation and despite things being not okay. Perhaps by having faith?
