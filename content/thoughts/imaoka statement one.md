1. I have faith (shinzuru) in myself. I recognize my own subjectivity and creativity and feel the worth of living in life (ikigai). Subjectivity and creativity can be rephrased as personality, divinity, and Buddha-nature.

Based on [[thoughts/andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown's]] explanation, faith (shinzuru) is an action I direct towards myself. It means "staying open" as often as I can to myself. This is exactly what Andrew told me:

>the most important thing is always to keep listening with an as open-mind and open-heart as possible...to what's going on in our own head and heart/body.

Listening here is what "true-entrusting" entails. This reminded me of [[thoughts/henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee]] who said that wherever one's thoughts came from should be trusted.

In affirming this, I ought to ask the following questions:
- How do I trust myself?
- How do I listen to myself?
- How do I keep an open heart and mind to that part of me which springs out thoughts and emotions, ever-changes, and sometimes direct my life?

Contemplative practices like [[thoughts/seiza|seiza]], [[thoughts/walking|walking]], [[thoughts/journaling is sacred|journaling]], and tending a [[thoughts/talahardin|Talahardin]] helps me listen to myself, a feat that could be really difficult sometimes.

Although I may have had some considerable progress in listening to myself, I'm unsure whether I've trusted myself enough. What does trusting oneself look like? Does it involve establishing my boundaries and protecting them? Or is witnessing the coming and going of my thoughts and emotions without judgment enough?

Listening to myself may also involve developing intuition and trusting my gut feel. But perhaps even more important is being open to change. I listen to change and trust it when it is persistent.

I am already doing this listening; I just have to strengthen and cultivate it.

In this [[thoughts/free religion|free religion]] path, it is wise to retreat to my well first and establish that center, that base, that stronghold before moving out.
