Stuck in places with small roads but too many vehicles.

Write my poetics the way I wrote Maui's brand strategy: start with what I want to feel in my creation process, during and after (including the results), and then articulate what I want my readers to feel.

Most Lms are prescriptive and autobiographical. To avoid this, we have to use generalities and tautologies in designing LMS.

It is so important for my morning routine to feel good. The act of creation as act of renewal, self-service. So this is where I still agree with Ginhawa Poetics. Where I deviate is how the poem should make others feel. We shouldn't prescribe. Because this hinders freedom.
