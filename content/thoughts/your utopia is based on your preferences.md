The answer to the question what world do I want to live in will always be subjective. Therefore, to answer this question, one needs to know oneself, one's inclinations ([[To live intentionally requires adequate self-knowledge]]). This self-knowledge involves knowledge of the complexity of the contents of the mind ([[majority of your practical knowledge should be self-knowledge]]), including [[Feelings]].

When one has established one's preferences, given [[Free will]], one will naturally desire a society, a world that satisfies those preferences and allows them to flourish, while minimizing or completely eradicating anything detrimental to those preferences.
