# Summary

When I asked Andrew how one begins walking in this creative, free spirituality, he suggested trying seiza. Practicing seiza for a month has taught me a lot about being mindful of my posture. More importantly, seiza introduced me to two new people I now see as partners in this creative, free spirituality I'm exploring. In November, I attended three seiza group meditation sessions via Zoom, led by Miki Nakura. In one of those sessions, I sat silently with Andrew James Brown.

Per Andrew's advice I also started studying the life of [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka (1881–1988)]] by reading the book [[literature/cosmic sage williams|Cosmic Sage]]. I also started reflecting on [[imaoka principles of living|Imaoka's Creed of Life]]. I synthesized what I learned so far in my essay [[a goodness lurking|"A Goodness Lurking: The Quest for a Free, Subsistent Spirituality]]."

Thinking about Imaoka put me back to my quest and framing my life into a ministry. I asked myself what kind of ministry would fit my current life and realized that what preoccupied most of my 20s after leaving the church was an exploration of writing. I was primarily self-taught, and most of my writing was highly personal. And yet, it was a writing life nonetheless.

So, I began considering how I could transform writing into a ministry. I considered the methods of the [[thoughts/transcendentalism|American Transcendentalists]] through the book [[literature/literary transcendentalism buell|Literary Transcendentalism]] by Lawrence Buell and learned that they were primarily preoccupied with how writing can both be a tool to go deeper into transcendentalism (i.e., to live a unique ethical life) and a vehicle to express the creative genius they believe reside within every human being.

I then encountered [[pat schneider]] whose writing method detailed in her book  [[writing alone and with others schneider|Writing Alone and with Others]] was used to transform writing into a method for spiritual and social change.

- Seiza

	- Met Andrew Brown.

## Writing Ministry

- I realized that although I still want a ministry, I'm not sure if I want to be a pastor again. Realization: Since I've dabbled with writing for almost half my life, I am considering living a ministry with writing at the center. Although working directly with people is something I would also love to have.
- Writing as a ministry: Enter [[pat schneider]]. I discovered her through her spiritual writing book How the Light Gets In. But I started studying here AWA method through her book [[writing alone and with others schneider|Writing Alone and with Others]].
	- I wrote on [[2023-11-23]]: "Whilst I adhere to free religion, I don't think being a pastor is really for me. I am not close to the possibility. But I am currently so in love with writing that it is what's calling me strongest right now. The only difference now is that aside from a personal writing practice, I intend to write with others together. I see writing is a vehicle to fulfill my ministry as a serious writer and a writing teacher following the tradition of the writing process movement."
- Did the first exercise: Beginning at Your Own Beginning.
