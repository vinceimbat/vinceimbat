When walking here in Cablong, in areas where I don't know the people and they are sitting on the side of the road, I feel uneasy. People here know everyone and so when someone is a visitor, an outsider, they know. And they unintentionally express this by looking at you almost watching you walk. In this circumstance walking really becomes a performance.

Feeling unease with this, I prefer walking alone in paths unfrequentes by humans.

Note the difference, the comfort I feel when walking in more urban spaces where I am hidden in a sea of anonymity even when I walk amid hundreds of people.
