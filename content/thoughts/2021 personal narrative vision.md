# My Home and Environment

`I am living in Los Baños. I transferred here to be nearer Lea, my friends, and creative opportunities. Moving here also begins my attempt to recreate my life, so that I can become unapologetically me. The place I live in is a place near nature, a place where I can do physical activities, where I can connect with like-minded and like-hearted people, where I can relax, reflect, and play.`

`I live in my personal space, which is designed to support my creative work.` **It is also conducive to friends and guests who I will welcome into my new life.** `I have designed and established systems to maintain and manage this space, all of which also support the life I want to build.`

# [[thoughts/my daily routine]]

`I wake up at 7:30 AM every day. I follow a daily routine that allows me to perform my most important actions: studying, writing/sharing, connecting, and living.`

# My Life Management System

`I have streamlined my Annual Review process to make it more organized and systematic in the coming years. My annual review is already tightly coupled with my daily and monthly review processes. Every day, I keep a 5MJ, which tracks the most important events in my day. I then use my 5MJ to create my Highlights of the Month at the end of each month. I write a one-paragraph summary of the Highlights of the Month, which I compile into a Highlights of the Year. I then use the Highlights of the Year to accomplish the core of my Annual Review.`

`I have created and streamlined my personal zettelkasten process.` `And by the end of 2021, I have accumulated a sizeable amount of notes from my daily note-writing practice. These notes have helped me be more familiar with my ideas, make my thinking sharper, and have assisted in my own writing.`

`Through this note-writing system, I have developed the theories and concepts that form the foundation of my life management system in individual notes that I keep in my zettelkasten.` **I have summarized those notes into an outline note that introduces my thinking on these. I improve all of these notes as needed.**

**I have also developed atomic ideas that make up my Ginhawa philosophy (feelosophy), which I keep in individual notes in my zettelkasten. Likewise, I have summarized these notes into an outline note. I improve all of these notes as needed. (?)**

`While building my zettelkasten, I have transferred a huge amount of information from my Evernote to my Craft.`

# My Physical Health

`I have established sustainable systems in purchasing, cooking, and eating food.` `I walk every day for exercise.` ::My eating habits have helped me bring my weight and BMI to normal.::

::I sleep by 12 MN every night, so I get a good 7 hours of sleep every night. I wake up feeling well-rested, energized, sharp, and kind, ready to take on the demands of the day.::

::My throat has completely healed and my LPR has never come back. My ear drum has healed significantly. It has closed for around 75%.::

# My Mental Health

`I have maintained tapering my psychiatric meds for the entire year without adverse effects.` `I take Exulten instead of Zolodin as it is easier to taper from it.` **I have found a psychiatrist who could provide me with a regular source of prescription.**

`I continue to manage my overall stress levels and well-being to continue and improve my habituation with tinnitus.`

# Relationships

`I am now living closer to Lea.` `While we are physically closer, we have maintained enough space for us to grow individually and not be overly dependent on each other. We bond at least two days a week.` `On days where we don't see each other, I call her in the evenings as usual.`

`I have helped Lea thrive in her freelancing career.` `She now makes all of her monthly income purely from freelancing.` `By the end of 2021, I have helped her be accountable in paying off her debt` **then starting to save for an emergency fund that could support her for three months of no work.**

`While I am in a relationship with her, she has become closer to her siblings even while she asserts her needs lovingly at home, teaching her siblings emotional intelligence through her example. Her relationship with her mom has also improved.` `I have created a bond with her mom, Dan, titas, and other close family members.`

`With my help, Lea has grown personally and professionally.` **By the end of 2021, I have also collaborated with her on a project that keeps us connected (?).**

::I call Ate Mau’s family at least once a month on Zoom for a dinner date. I also call at home at least once a month.::

**I have clearly defined what I want from my relationships and I have started surrounding myself with the right people.**

`I have peaceful relationships with all my neighbors. I do not express my problems in an antagonistic manner. I let go of small things. If there are major things that need to be addressed, I do so by talking to them directly in a peaceful and nonviolent way.`

# Sustenance

`I have established a plan for my finances and material life. I have identified the goals that I need to accomplish financially and the habits that will get me there.`

`I continue to work at Scribendi.` **I have also found a second source of stable income online, which will be my buffer in case Scribendi orders are fewer than usual.**

`I have identified and bought a good HMO card.` **I have identified and started contributing on a good health insurance plan.**

**I have also identified and implemented a way to make the patron model work for me, so that I can continue doing what I do best: developing and producing insights. (?)**

# Mission

`I have revisited all my past notes on my life work and rearticulated them to adjust with new data (like my plan to incorporate zettelkasten into my workflow and my recent move to LB).` `So far, I have decided on the following points:`

- `I cannot commit to a clear content (at least not hard commit) for now, as it is too early for that. What I commit to for now is the method: self-directed, non-hierarchical, and autonomous thinking established on a daily note-writing practice, which is the foundation for bigger outputs. My method is content agnostic, which means I can explore a lot of topics and fields on the way towards eventually committing to something.`
- `My content will come later and evolve. So I focus on a good foundation for my method. I should be able to explore different subjects as needed. I do not hold on a certain belief. I only hold on the pursuit of truth. That pursuit will require me to change ideas and beliefs and, therefore, subjects of interest.`

**To support me in this mission, I have created a plan to design and build a community that will support me as I pursue my mission (?).** ::I am conversing and connecting with people who are self-directed and autonomous thinkers who are also deeply grounded in the application of their beliefs into their daily lives and who are sharing their story beautifully. To maintain this engagement, I have established a habit of regularly searching for and reaching out to peers who do the work that I want to do in the space that I want to contribute to. I reach out to mentors, peers, and potential followers of my work.::

`Aside from the daily note-writing practice, I have implemented a regular weekly newsletter publishing routine (Lilim) to experience a regular expression of my truth. I am also writing and sharing occassional day-by-day observations via Yesterday, I…`

`I have relearned photography and photographic storytelling.`

**I have translated all my favorite Thoreau quotes in his journal and have prepared the first manuscript draft of the book Talaarawan ni Thoreau. (?)**

**I have learned how to take videos and edit them correctly and compiled short binaural videos in my Worn-out Wheels project.**

**I have learned how to write authentically using my own voice.**

`I have integrated walking in my creative process.`

**I have learned how to build a website using a static generator.**

**I have learned coding for web development.**

**I have learned design principles.**

# Art

While dedicating a lot of time to my mission, I do not neglect my hobbies and passion projects, which I do to immerse myself further into play.

# Note

- There has to be a mechanism for you to see what you changed in this document and what its original contents were. It's impotant to see what you originally wrote at the beginning of the year.
- However, take note that it isn’t really adviseable to change the contents per se. What you update is the list of life goals related to these life areas, but not their content. You have to design the PNV to be a tool to create a foundation for your areas, a bird’s eye view narrative of your life rather than a detailed plan.
