It is the 20th century new critics who championed that the process that lead to writing was less important than its result: the published literary work. New critics espoused the Romantic fantasy of spontaneous creation and genius (read: if genius comes spontaneously, then there is no use for process).

This principle also implies that a published literary work is self-containing and complete (i.e., whole and final) and that its interpretation can be found within itself.

Since it favors the [[draft]] and is designed under the principle that [[art is never finished|art is never finished]], the [[talahardin|talahardin]] is a rejection of new criticism.
