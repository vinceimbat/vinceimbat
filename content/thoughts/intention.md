Intentions are statements about future states that one desires to be in.

One may create intentions about ACTIONS and ENDS.

Both serve their purposes.

Intentions about ENDS remind us what we really are going after, thus the standard for evaluating the effectiveness of our actions.

Intentions about ACTIONS, on the other hand, inform us of the system, the process, the daily practices, the habits that we need to manifest if we are to realize our ENDS.
