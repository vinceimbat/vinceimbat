# Past Year Questions

## List your 3 top wins for the year.

1. Perhaps the biggest win I had this year was articulating my purpose clearer and feeling stronger about its authenticity. It just feels right that [[thoughts/my purpose is to live deliberately]]. This purpose is the guiding light of [[thoughts/my quest]]. To make it possible for me to realize this purpose, I need to maximize creative freedom in my life so I could engage in independent creative, philosophical, and contemplative projects. Articulating this has clarified [[My livelihood system]].
2. The second biggest win of the year is being able to clarify the kind of writing I want to study and master: creative non-fiction personal essays that delve on universal and philosophical subject matters, which are place-based and use the romantic excursion as a literary device. Ultimately, I want to produce beautiful non-fiction books with photographs that combine personal narratives, philosophical thinking, cultural references, and historical descriptions all situated in a specific geographical location. This realization inspired me to combine all my writings no matter what their genre is and no matter what stage they are in the writing process into a single digital garden: [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]]. It also led me to launch The Long Walk and several Lilim articles in 2022.
3. The third biggest win of the year is experiencing the clarifying aftermath of two big losses in my life at the end of the year: the loss of Rem and the loss of my day job. Rem's loss strengthened my resolve to accept the religious nature of what I am doing with writing, walking, and photography—something I resisted for a long time. The loss of a dependable source of income helped me see with clarity the importance of mastery when engaging with the exchange economy and how mindfulness could transform any activity considered nuisance into something valuable.

## What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned in the past year?

- I learned that utang na loob culture is toxic and my family is a victim of this culture and that I need to be part of the revolution against it. This involves building resilience so we don't have to constantly and heavily rely on others.
- I learned the following insight: plateau experiences are more valuable than peak experiences -> everything is fleeting -> since everything is fleeting, we might as well live life intentionally.
- I learned a simply framework to improve my writing practice: write with focus, read with purpose, and build community.
- I learned through first-hand experience that long-distance walking makes one come face to face with social and cultural reality and that there are lessons one can only learn while walking.
- I deepened my understanding of Thoreau: the romantic excursion, his quest, and his philosophical stance.
- I learned about lyrical philosophy.
- I learned about Henry Bugbee and his works and the importance of insights as they come.
- I learned how to approach goal-setting simply yet effectively by using the [[thoughts/warren buffet list]].
- I learned that it is possible to be an atheist and yet religious.
- I learned that I had a fear of religion and yet the work I am doing is religious in nature.
- I learned how to write, editi, and send poems to a publication for potential release.
- I learned how to treat all kinds of writings I do at no matter what stage as part of a single ecosystem: a digital garden.
- I learned how to live happily with another human being.
- I learned how to budget my money and share a fund with my partner.
- I learned that in the exchange economy, we must build a highly rare skill that we could exchange for rare goods like high pay, freedom, and worthwhile work.
- I learned why it is so difficult for artists to navigate the exchange economy and that they can do so by taking on a day job, building a business component in their art without destroying its integrity, finding patrons, and living a simple life.
- I learned that it is possible to build strong, real, and authentic relationships in such a short life if one truly wants them.
- I learned the importance of having a strong home and well, which includes a metaphysical and epistemological home that I could return to while I practice tolerance and compassion towards others.
- I learned to look closer at the things we currently have and to see their value and give them the attention they deserve lest they leave us.
- I learned how to apply design thinking and principles in designing a life. For example, I now know that there is no single best life but many lives and that the next move is more important that the overall purpose.
- I learned that there are Pangasinenses dedicated in promoting the Pangasinan language and the depth of their efforts in doing so.
- I learned how to read the night sky.
- I learned how to teach LMS to someone.

## What were the risks you took?

- Walking from Los Baños to San Pablo with very little knowledge of what I would expect from the walk.
- Living in with Lea despite criticism from her mom and family.

## What was your most loving service?

- Supporting Lea throughout her journey towards independence and self-actualization in 2022.

## What is your unfinished business from the past year?

- Building a livelihood system that feels better, builds resilience, and encourages me to pursue the work I want to do.

## What are you most happy about completing?

- I am happy I was able to migrate my website from Wordpress to Hugo using Congo then later transitioning it into a digital garden using Quartz and integrating all of my writing in Obsidian. Although this setup still needs improvement, I am happy that I am able to have this system in place that allows me to think easier.

## Who were the three people that had the greatest impact on your life in the past year?

1. Thoreau - Returning to him made me understand what kind of writing I want to do (leading me to other writers I want to read) as well as clarifying my purpose.
2. Henry Bugbee - He pointed our the importance of insights to me, compelling me to value my insights as they come and marking them as "seeds." He made me realize that what I am doing has a religious nature to it. He helped me appreciate that the purpose of philosophy is to help us be responsible and act appropriately in life.
4. Andrew James Brown - He helped me confront the reality of the religious nature of what I want to do and introduced me to processes and people who can help me in this return.
5. Honorable mention: Rem - His loss has clarified where I want to go next in life

## What was your biggest surprise?

Rem's death

## What compliment would you liked to have received? Given?

I would liked to have received a compliment from any of my parents or perhaps family members about my writing, specifically my poetry. But, oh well, thinking about this won't be constructive for me.

I wish I could have complimented someone from being kind. I wish I saw more kindness in 2022 and reinforced it by complimenting kind people.

## What else do you need to do or say to be complete with the past year?

None. I don't feel that my year is incomplete.

## What one word or phrase best sums up and describes your experience this past year?

Commitment

## What stories from the past year are you letting go of?

- The story that I could continue earning a high amount of money in just a short time without giving enough effort.
- The story that I need to practice tolerance and compassion without a center to hold me stronger.
- The story that I should continuously rely on my parents or aunts and uncles for material support, thus strengthening utang na loob culture.
