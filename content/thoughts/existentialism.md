But I understand Mooney here. Being an existentialist, he is partial that for the big questions it is hollow. Indeed it seems to be the case and we have very limited answers for the big questions. Therefore, focus on what we know, what we are sure of. The little things. The day to day realities.

The biggest surprise to the intellectually curious is that when you are patient enough to ask the question "why," you will come to a point when you realize there is no big purpose, no God, nothing up there. Depending on your taste, you would either treat this as doom or liberation.
