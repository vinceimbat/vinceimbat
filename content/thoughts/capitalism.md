I have started to feel skeptical of capitalism. I am in search of a middle ground. I still think it is the way to optimizing human freedom. But it can be taken far ahead. With community out. What is the best way to live an economic life?

I may not be totally sold by the argument that the world is heading towards an environmental Armageddon, but the capitalist consumerist system is breaking down the things that are important to me: esp. values.
