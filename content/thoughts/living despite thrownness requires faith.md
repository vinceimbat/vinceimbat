[[walking|Walking]] in a frightening world is friendship, not only to wisdom but also to where it comes from: the world, both in the mind and the physical world one acts in. Every day I go back to my journal, every afternoon I walk on the trails, I am befriending the world.

Befriending the world is only possible through faith. When I existed and realized that existence, I have no knowledge to support a decision to learn about and befriend the world. I am putting faith, I am surrendering, that everything will be okay if this is how I respond to my thrownness.

When we choose to befriend the world despite our thrownness, we start to realize that [[thoughts/our thrownness is a gift]].
