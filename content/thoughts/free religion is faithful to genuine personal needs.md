It is interesting how [[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] thinks about the "ready-made-ness" of religions. He said that to gather the best parts of all religions and integrate them into a single ideal religion is still using what is ready-made. What he seems to suggest is to really begin at the individual level (i.e., what does the individual need?). Then begin thinking about how to integrate what exists out there into one's faith. I like how he describes the nature of such an individual religion: "it represents the most personal, realistic, and tangible form of faith" and it is "about being faithful to our genuine demands."
