Because I believe in [[Pluralism]], I believe in a world where everyone could practice their beliefs but still coexist with each other. For coexistence to happen, entities within this plural society will have to tell each other if some of their behavior is undermining their freedom. This is what constitutes a [[Brave space]].

A safe space is not necessarily a brave space. You can feel safe in a particular space but afraid to voice out your contrarian opinion. In such a space the feeling of security is faux. A true safe space is a brave space, where you are encouraged to disagree if you need to.

And [[We need brave spaces rather than safe spaces in all our relationships]].
