Problems
- hindi sa sure if feasible
- organizing
- logistics
- finances, sponsors
- pricing sponsors
- they want na sila lang ang leg work
- should they start small
- experience

think: how can we work together?
- planning strategizing
- marketing
- outreach
- canvassing (yung ticket depends on the money you want to generate)

Solutions
- Crowdsource for who can be sponsors: from the community may mga nagsponsors
- collect names then reach out

Past Experiences
- Peace Summit: progressive schools, Ateneo 
- nagawa na ni Joji
- sponsors big din: Smart, Inquirer, Metrobank, pharma companies

Questions
- bakit ayaw ni Joji na gawin?
- how much do you need?
- how big is the summit? how many people? (~300)

Ideas
- ticket sales
- the bigger the goal, the more bullshit could happen
