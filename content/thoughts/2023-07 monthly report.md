# Summary

After my afternoon walk on [[2023-07-12]], I was convinced that I shouldn't let my current financial situation affect my writing life, at the very least my morning writing routine. This led me to review my writing life in general, including my systems and routines and evaluate them against my creative goals. I was intent in checking whether my current writing system is leading me towards my goals. The result of this process was a better articulation of [[my poetics|my poetics]]. This process reminded me that what I truly wanted to write is [[lyrical philosophy|lyrical philosophy]]â€”words that combine the beauty of the poem and the depth of philosophical inquiry. Thus, I articulated [[thoughts/how to practice and write lyrical philosophy|how to practice and write lyrical philosophy]].

This process got me back to writing. While I made significant progress in my sustenance projects for Candent and Ili Likhaan (both websites are ready to launch), I was also able to get back to writing.

Some of my favorite writings include the walk poem drafts:
- [[walk poem 1|Walk Poem 1]]
- [[walk poem 2|Walk Poem 2]]

I wrote these poems initially as fragments of observations during two afternoon walks. My rule was to write a brief note on whatever piqued my interest or whatever thought calls on the walk and to separate these lines per street where they occurred. Thus the number of stanzas equal the number of streets walked.

One Sunday morning, another poem came to me: [[those stairs at bakakeng|Those Stairs at Bakakeng]].

Aside from these, I enjoyed writing these notes:
- [[thoughts/suicide|suicide]]
- [[thoughts/some experiences resist articulation|some experiences resist articulation]]
- [[thoughts/public life is necessary|public life is necessary]]

Lastly, I added my essay [[a never-ending walk|A Never-ending Walk]] in [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|my forest garden of the mind]] and shared it in the [[newsletters]].

The best books I read this month were:
- [[thoughts/isang taong maghapon by paolo tiausas|Isang Taong Maghapon by Paolo Tiausas]]
- [[inahan sa sugilanon far|Inahan sa Sugilanon by Louise Far]]

I also re-read [[the collapse of what separates us serrano|The Collapse of What Separates Us by Vincenz Serrano]] to study the poems closely. I'll be sharing my notes on the site soon.

An essay I really loved reading this month was [[melt the snowflake at once by david rothenberg|Melt the Snowflake at Once! by David Rothenberg]].
