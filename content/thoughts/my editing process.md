# A. Proofreading

Address all objective mechanical errors:
- Grammar and punctuation
- Spelling and typography
- Referencing
- Mechanical consistency
- Formatting

# B. Copyediting

Address matters of subjective taste:
- Register, tone and word choice (keep in mind subject matter and audience)
- Poorly constructed phrases or sentences (even grammatically correct)
- Reduce wordiness and repetition.
- Leave comments and feedback for the author.
- Never change author's intended meaning.

# C. Adhere to client's requirements
