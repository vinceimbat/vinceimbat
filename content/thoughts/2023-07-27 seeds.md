I am amazed by how much the body is capable of generating happiness. The sky is dark. It is cold. But just because I am well-fed. I took a nap this afternoon, I feel a deep satisfaction, brave, unperturbed.

I cannot analyze myself to loving someone nor feel in awe and amazed and moved by something. The strongest emotions that convince us we want to stay a bit longer were never the product of analysis. Think if you may. You cannot escape it. But never ever over do it. It's on not to understand some things.

Essay idea: relate your desire to take care of your health so you can avoid what happened to your mom and still walk more.
