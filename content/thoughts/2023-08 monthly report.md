# Summary

In August, in between wrapping up a web design project with a client and starting a research writing project for a returning client, I managed to do some writing and studying. I returned to my study of [[thoughts/existentialism|existentialism]] by reading [[thoughts/jack gilbert|Jack Gilbert's]] poetry book *[[refusing heaven gilbert|Refusing Heaven]]*.

I enjoyed writing two notes this month:
- [[thoughts/public life is necessary|Public life is necessary]]
- [[thoughts/mindfulness over analysis|Mindfulness over analysis]]

I managed to publish three newsletter issues:

- [[the very first memory|The Very First Memory]]
- [[lolo aldo|Lolo Aldo]]
- [[in july|In July]]

This August, I decided to apply to a regional writer's workshop that accepted works in my native [[tags/pangasinan|Pangasinan]] language. At first, I thought I should send some Pangasinan poems (*anlong*), so I finished [[billy collins masterclass|Billy Collins' Masterclass]], which I thought should help me revise the poems better. But after finishing the course, I realized I wanted to focus on writing [[thoughts/lyric essay|lyric essays]]. This is a genre of writing that I have been doing for the past two years long before I've ever discovered the term, and although I love reading and writing poetry, I wanted to stay closer to something that was true to me and get better at it. Plus, the book about walking in Los Baños, which I am currently working on will be a book of lyric essays. Might as well practice now.

What resulted was [[mulimuli pangasiniani|Mulimuli Pangasiniani]], which I translated into English as [[translations/perturbations on pangasiniani|Perturbations on Pangasiniani]]. It is a lyric essay about my personal struggles in writing in my mother tongue. While working on this essay, I read the works of other lyric essayists. A book that was particularly helpful was the anthology *[[a harp in the stars noble|A Harp in the Stars]]* edited by R. B. Noble.

I also started a collaborative writing project with a co-fellow at the Ateneo National Writer's Workshop: [[jesa suganob|Jesa Suganob]]. Our project involves doing a series of walks from August to the end of September. We're free to choose on which days to do the walking as long as we use each walk as a prompt for writing an epistolary essay on that walk. The essay is directed towards each other, but we won't send the essays until the end of the project.

Meanwhile, my friend Patricia Domingo ([@promdikusinera](https://www.instagram.com/promdikusinera/)) recently launched a newsletter about her adventures as a Filipina chef. She called it [Salu-salo](https://salusalo.substack.com/), which means gathering, celebration, or feast. Cha is an earnest and uplifting writer and I really enjoyed her first issue (["Pause and Play"](https://salusalo.substack.com/p/pause-and-play)) where she talks about adobo, rest, and self-directed learning. She also described the [[thoughts/nasa labas ang ili|Nasa Labas ang Ili]] meditative walks I facilitated at UPLB last April.

Lastly, I was also able to update this website, which currently runs on a free open-source markdown publishing technology called [Quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), to the latest version (v4). I experience some major hiccups along the ways: one involved my website being down for more than an hour and me having to rebuild it from scratch. Major lessons: Update only when necessary. Don't try to fix what isn't broken. Introduce changes slowly. These lessons are also transferrable to almost everything in life.
