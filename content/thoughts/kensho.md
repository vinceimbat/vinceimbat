>For what it is worth, as far as I have come to understand it, the “kensho” experience in free-religion is quite different from that available in many/most traditional religious traditions. What is seen (or one can have reasonable hopes of seeing) in a moment of free-religious kensho is, for me, summed-up well in Imaoka Shin’ichirō-sensei’s eight statements. It’s about seeing, really seeing, how diversity and difference — although it is a fundamental part of reality that has to be acknowledged and lived with — never need stop us from seeing how, somehow, we always-already remain meaningfully connected with each other and all things.
