I like how Jack Gilbert does it. His poems are almost vignettes. And they could easily be vignettes seen outdoors.

Methodology learned from reading his poems (connect this to [[thoughts/my poetics|my poetics]]).
1. Sharpen your grasp of existentialism
2. Sharpen your knowledge of ways to execute existential language
3. Sharpen your observation skills and mindfulness
4. Walk and catch existential images outdoors
