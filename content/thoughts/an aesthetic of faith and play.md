Then focus on strengthening your writing practice. Begin by clearly articulating this in an essay for Sunday. The essay will be about the principle of jumping and how it translates to:
- spirituality
- Walking
- Writing (where they all converge)

A spirituality attuned to nature (ie, to how things are)

Connect this to divergence, convergence: we only find something we've settled on after trying different things, allowing ourselves to fail.

But also mention that sometimes, we no longer feel the need to converge on anything and we diverge many times we see it as the principle. Our convergences become simply snapshots.

Spirituality
- two ways: follow the religion of our parents or be free or 

Walking
- share the walk poem examples
- when walking is used as a method, you can either let the different images dictate what is next then stop and write about what catches you on that very moment or revisit your notes after the walk. The converging happens after, the jumping and diverging has happened during the walk.
- Of course, sometimes converging is sometimes let go altogether

Photography could be an even more gnenerous media for this aesthetic.

Writing
- mention Billy Collins' process
- Mention Pat Schneider
- Mention Rem Tanauan and Flow
