There is a unique boundary between our experiences.

We know enough to know that we dont know enough.

The boundaries of our experiences might be porous and artificial.

[[The self exists]].

But not in the way we think it exists.

Yes the contents of my mind changes.

But the container does not

The metaphysics of matter is different from the metaphysics of mind

I am a perspective of awareness that is constant

Or is the self snapshots? If the I are snapshots and they are relational, then it makes sense that the I is collective.

Is the [[thoughts/mind]] the same as the self?
