<h2>I was thrown here—alone and oblivious. The landscape is gray, cold, and frightening. I stared at the horizon and immediately understood—I knew nothing of this terrain.</h2>

I wanted to leave, but instead, I did what I knew I had to do. I set forth for [[thoughts/the long walk|a long walk]] into [[thoughts/wilderness|the Wilderness]].

As I walk, I cover two planes simultaneously—a finite [[thoughts/geographical wilderness]] and a vast and never-ending [[thoughts/mental wilderness]]. [[thoughts/walking|Walking]] in geographic space expands the mind. Walking the mind deepens the meaning of geographic space.

In this excursion, which ends only in death, I gather [seeds](tags/seeds) of thoughts, verses, images, and experiences. I pocket these seeds until I find the right soil to plant them, here in a third space—cyberspace.

I revisit what were planted rhythmically to tend to them, re-walking once verdant valleys and creating trails through my footsteps—trails that connect what later become [seedlings](tags/seedlings). I am bound to re-walk these trails and re-walk them again, until what were planted have grown into [evergreens](tags/evergreens).

One day, I will be surrounded by [[thoughts/my forest garden of the mind|a forest garden of the mind]], and everything will finally make sense.

I walk only to find answers to one question: [[thoughts/how to live|how to live?]]

I write these words and share them here if only I can make this thrown existence more meaningful.

Would you like to walk with me?
