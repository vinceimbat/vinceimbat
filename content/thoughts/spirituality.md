In relation to [[thoughts/free religion|free religion]], I define it as an attitude of caring. It is a reverence we feel toward anything, which usually begins in faith, and which inspires us to attend to it with love and quality of action.

It is a concept one can use to differentiate a quality of "mechanical-ness" or cut-throat competition.
