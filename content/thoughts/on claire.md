# Thoughts on Claire

Bibitawan ko na muna lahat ng responsibilities o promises ko na konektado sayo at kay Rem: website, archiving, Daop Diwa organizing. Ayokong may nagseset sa akin ng expectations at kapag hindi ko naabot ay nagtatampo o nagagalit sa akin.

Si Lea halos walang expectations sa akin. Sayo ko lng naramdaman ito. At naging ganyan ka ever since namatay si Rem. Angdami-dami mong gustong ipagawa sa amin.

Naapreciate ko ang pagsasabi mo ng totoo mong nararamdaman. At mas gusto ko pa ring patuloy mo itong gawin moving forward.

Pero hindi ang pagsasabi ng totoo ang isyu ko.

Tatlo ang isyu ko sayo:
1. Mali ang conclusion mo na naglead to your pagtatampo, so whatever tampo you felt that day was unfounded.
2. Mali ang timing mo.
3. Hindi mo nirespeto ang boundary na sinet ko dati.

Wala sa msg mo na humihingi ka ng tulong.
Hindi mo pwedeng parating gawing dahilan ang medical condition mo o therapy

Naiinis ako dahil masyadong malayo ang tinaboy mo to make a conclusion. I was simply stating an innocent fact: there is no way for me to know whether or not I will be available on any given date. Kung ineexpect mo naman pala na mag-yes kami sa lahat ng isusuggest mong dates, bakit ka pa magtatanong ng availability namin? Kung magtatampo ka pala kapag hindi kami pwd sa dates na dinetermine mo, bakit ka p magtatanong?

Hindi ko maintindihan saan nanggagaling itong pagtatampo mo. Maling-mali ang interpretation mo sa sagot ko.

Kung masungit man ang message ko ay yun ay naiinis ako sa insensitivity mo sa paglapit sa akin ng paulit-ulit, borderline pangungulit, given na napaka-wrong timing ito para gawin.

Malinaw ang request ko sayo nung nag-usap tayo na wag muna akong kulitin tungkol sa kahit na ano except pathfinder's commune website dahil nakatutok ako sa paghahanda sa workshop. Mabigat sa akin ang workshop dahil maselan ang laman ng essay ko at hindi madaling humarap sa mga strangers habang kinukuwento ko for the first time ang mga nangyari sa akin.

Ang hindi ko maintindihan ay kung bakit prang napakataas ng expectation mo sa akin as a friend samantalang ikaw hindi ka effective na nagpapakita ng sensitivity sa akin, specifically sa paghingi ko ng space.

Drinop mo yang unfounded message mo accusing me of not prioritizing Daop Diwa on the very wrong time. Grabe ang epekto mo sa akin. Imbes na nakafocus ako sa sarili ko the entire workshop, you were at the back of my mind. Sobrang sama ng loob ko sayo sa ginawa mong yun.

I refuse to accept na sayo lng dapat umikot ang mundo after mawala ni Rem, na lahat ng kailngan mo ay kailngan naming iprovide, na kailngan naming magsakripisyo prati para sayo. At magtatampo ka kapag hindi ka namin napagbibigyan. Hindi lang ikaw nag nagggrieve. Hindi lang ikaw ang may pinagdaraanan. Hindi lang ikaw ang kaibigan kong kailangan kong tulungan. Masakit man itong sabihin, ito ang totoo. At ayaw kong isugarcoat iyan.

You don't have any idea about what I too am going through because you don't care. You make me feel like you are the only one grieving and that you are asking our help always and at the wrong time.

Resolution:
- i am not the right person to provide you whatever it is you need at the moment.
- I would like to focus on my needs completely.
- I resign from all my responsibilities for managing Rem's websites etc.

I won't expect you to understand why I had to restrict you at that time. I was feeling so stressed with the workshop, that thought of baring myself open to a group of strangers that you expressing your frustration to me just made things worse. I wish you didn't do that. I wish you had better timing. But you didn't and that is why I reacted the way I did.

Why am I being compelled to do the fixing?
I don't think I did anything wrong.

Hindi ko iieexpect na maintindihan mo ako dahil hindi natin naabot ang lalim ng pagkakaibigang narating namin ni Rem, pero

I am writing this because I still believe we might be able to continue this friendship with some work.

I will express what I didn't like about our previous interaction and what made me distance from you.

What I didn't like about our previous interaction

When you ask too many things from me and message me about them many times and several times a week, especially at the wrong time, you drain me. Napapatanong nalang ako minsan, "Kelan ba to matatapos?" Noong nagkita tayo sa Elbi Commons, humingi ako ng space na wag muna akong kulitin sa kahit na ano related kay Rem o sayo at least until matapos ang Ateneo workshop dahil mabigat ang prosesong pinagdadaanan ko in preparing for that workshop.

Despite that request, sunod-sunod parin ang pangungulit mo sa akin about things: website, fundraising, newsletter mo, tapos biglang etong Daop Diwa. Sunod-sunod ang paghingi mo ng tulong na parang pakiramdam ko mas mahalaga sayo na matulungan ka kaysa maging kaibigan ka sa akin. Naiintindihan ko na kailangan mo ng tulong lalo na ngayon at tutulong ako pero tutulong lang ako sa paraang maginhawa sa akin.

Boundaries moving forward

If we do continue with our friendship, here are my boundaries:

1. Tell her you're dealing with so much and overwhelmed you cant help her right now.

1. Hindi ko gusto na nagseset ka ng expectations sa akin na pagtatampuhan mo kapag hindi ko mafulfill. To avoid the risk of this happening, iwiwithdraw ko muna lahat ng promises ko regarding helping you with Rem's legacy, including archives and websites. Moving on, I prefer honoring Rem's legacy in my own way, without collaborating with anyone.
2. You should respect my need to not go to events that don't resonate with me even if these are your events.

- your timing was off. I dont mind being confronted with whatever i did wrong. Just dont do it a day before the workshop.
- Since u did it before the workshop i feel like u care less about my needs. I was going in the workshop with a sensitive story. And perhaps our friendship is not that deep that you dont care that much about my story or what i am going through but i still am grieving my past life and i felt like ur message disrespected that
- I also didnt like the content of the msg to be honest. U have so high expectations from me as a friend i dont think i will ever fulfill. Despite everything i've done for you, my loyalty was still questioned.
- If this friendship will continue, you need to respect my boundaries.

I am messaging because I learned from Rem's death that we can lose each other anytime and I even if I badly needed a break from you, I also don't want to keep this silence between the two of us more than necessary.

Explain why you needed a break from her

---

I understand and hear your hurt by my message but what ticked me off was you sending your message of frustration a day before my workshop, when I was feeling a lot of anxiety and grief because what I wrote was about grief and I was going through a lot

I needed to distance myself from you because what you did was just unacceptable to me.

Wag mo gagamitin sakin parati yang Rem card or yang health problem card mo. Dahil hindi lng ikaw ang naggrieve kay Rem at hindi lng ikaw ang may pinagdaraanan.

Hi Claire,

How have you been?

Nabanggit sakin ni Lea na nag-usap kayo tungkol satin. Wag kang maniwala sa kaniya. Kunwari lng na hindi niya alam pero alam talaga niya.

Hindi ako kumibo dahil hindi ko pa sigurado hanggang ngayon kung paano sisimulang makipag-usap sayo tungkol sa nangyari sa'tin. At pakiramdam ko kailangan ko pa rin ng space.

Pero binibiyak ko na ang silence ko dahil kung meron man akong natutunan sa pagkawala ni Rem, yun ay sobrang ikli ng buhay ay hindi parating nandito ang mga mahal natin.

So let this message tell you that I am open to talking more about us and mending this in the near future when I am ready.

Greeting

Mention Lea

Sabi ni Lea, akala mo raw at simpleng tampuan lang itong nangyari satin na maikokorek kaagad. Kaya nagtataka ka kung bakit matagal akong bumalik sayo.

Mukhang hindi malinaw sayo why I acted the way I acted, so magsisimula ako sa pagpapaliwanag doon.

[Explain why you have to distance from her]

I have two main reasons for distancing myself from you:
1. I feel under appreciated with the things I am doing for you after Rem died. I know I could do better but I am doing my best despite going through my own problems. And yet I felt like you need more from me, you're demanding more than I can give, and when I cannot meet your expectations you get frustrated as you did in that message you sent a day before my workshop.
2. I felt like my personal space was threatened. I repeatedly mentioned to you that I was preparing for my workshop that it was important for me to focus on it and be bothered by as little as possible and yet you repeatedly barraged me with questions and requests, esp. on that week before the workshop. This culminated on that message of frustration you sent me on August 8. I told you I cannot be bothered but you still sent your message of frustration, which affected me the entire workshop.

I have to get away from you because I felt that my personal space was threatened.

I am open to mending this friendship because I still value you and the things we shared together. But I will only participate in our frienship again if you honor my boundaries. At any moment that I feel like my boundaries are crossed, I will not hesitate to distance myself from you again.

Here are my boundaries.

---

you cannot make those kinds of demands
if you want to continue being my friend, you have to stop demanding me to go to your events if I don't want to. You could feel bad about my decision, but you shouldn't tell that to me because it makes me feel like I'm a bad friend for wanting not to go. You should also stop demanding me to stay longer than I want.

In other words, if you want this friendship to continue, you have to respect:
1. My freedom to go or not to go to events of my choosing.
2. My freedom to prioritize things in my life.
3. My freedom to leave early in evens.

Whenever I communicate my boundary, you need to be very mindful of it and I expect you to respect it immediately without me repeating it. If you repeatedly break my boundaries, then I am out of this friendship.

You need to understand, respect, and not feel resentful if I cannot show up for you because I need to show up on things that are important for me first.

I was really pissed off because you didn't seem to understand how important things are too me while you are demanding that I do that to the things important to you.

I told you on that day that I was attending the workshop the following day and that my mind was preoccupied on that but you still dropped your bomb.

That really pissed me off. Whatever thing I did to wrong you (which I disagree btw) should've waited after my workshop. When you did that I felt like you didn't get me. You are demanding that I value Daop Diwa but you didn't show that you value the process I am going through. Napagod ako maging kaibigan ka. Parang everytime I am around you, everything revolves around your needs as if I don't have mine. And I couldn't give what you need. I just can't. I understand that you are going through something so terrible.

---

Alam kong nagexpress ka lang ng frustration sa message na yun pero kasi brineak mo ang nilatag kong boundary sayo, which made me lose trust on your ability to remember and respect my boundaries.

I have to get away from you because it feels tiring to repeatedly say what I want and to repeatedly get it broken. What you did made me doubt whether you really care about my needs or you just see me as a resource that you tap on whenever you need something. As harsh as that may sound that is what you made me feel after what you did. And I'm not sure I want to be in that kind of relationship.

**The main reason for my disconnection from Claire is she violated a boundary I clearly delineated.**

My distancing from her is a consequence of what she did. Getting away from her is a justified action.

---

I don't want to connect with Claire unless I know she's changed because I am hurt (i.e., I am constantly bombarded by messages etc.).

**My boundary with her will be no messenger interaction with her.**

At the current state of our relationship, here are my boundaries on Claire:
1. No social media interaction
2. No project collaboration
