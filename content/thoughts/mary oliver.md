Mary Oliver wrote with detail and insight. Detail: Her descriptions of what she saw were vivid enough for me to be able to travel there and see what she is seeing—to the best of my abilities. Insight: Some of her poems are just pure insights—interesting insights I wish I thought of. The comibination of detail and insight makes her work powerful.
