There are three kinds of research:

1. [[Pure basic research]]
2. [[Pure applied research]]
3. Use-inspired basic research

I ascribe to a use-inspired basic research, because I seek a fundamental understanding of nature so that I could solve immediate problems.

To apply a use-inspired basic research in [[My life plan]], I need to do two things:

1. Generate insight through creating prototypes ([[Some life prototypes]]).
2. Develop ideas far enough that they become “obvious”.

To do

- What does the last point mean? Create a new note for it.
