Here is [[thoughts/andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown's]] advice on how to begin one's journey in [[thoughts/free religion|free religion]].

>the most important thing is always to keep listening with an as open-mind and open-heart as possible, both to what's going on all around us and also to what's going on in our own head and heart/body. Just beginning a simple practise of Seiza (Quiet Sitting) meditation is, I'm sure, a good and gentle place to begin this kind of non-judgemental listening.

See [[seiza]].

>The other helpful exercise is, I think, to meditate on how in your own life you might be able to find ways to affirm [[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Imaoka Shin'ichirō-sensei's]] eight statements of faith.

>All in all, I genuinely think that holding his eight points in mind, plus a practise of Quiet sitting, along (perhaps) with reading slowly and meditatively through the "Selected Writings on Free Religion and Other Subjects"

>Given your direct, and no doubt very painful, experience with the JWs, getting a strong sense of who you are as a free-religious person before you walk through another community's doors is really, really important. Without a working, recalibrated compass of your own, you won't be able truly to tell whether they are genuinely practising a free-religion or just a slightly more liberal version of conventional religion.
