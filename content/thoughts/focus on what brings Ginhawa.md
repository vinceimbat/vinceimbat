I need to have a list of things that actually makes me feel Ginhawa and focus on these when I work or continue with life.

What makes me feel Ginhawa?

- A comfortable space
- Time affluence to use for learning
- Making sense of what I am learning
- Writing and sharing my findings to others
- Learning and engaging in physical and practical work
- Conversing with friends
- Visiting places
- Being with communities
- Playing
- Being with Nature
- Destroying routine and monotony (sometimes)
