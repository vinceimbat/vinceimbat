Everything begins with [[thoughts/purpose]]. [[my purpose is to live deliberately]].

To imagine what fulfilling my purpose looks like, I wrote [[my vision statement]].

To imagine how my vision could translate into action and allow myself to track my progress, I have created [[thoughts/my life areas]].

Within my life areas are goals that I track in [[my life goals master list]].

To ensure that I am performing actions that lead me toward my goals, I set up [[Routines]].
