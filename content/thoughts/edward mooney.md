Edward Mooney has an outdated blog: [Mists on the Rivers](https://edmooneyblog.wordpress.com/). In the about page, he describes what the blog contains:
>*I would write here and now in praise of Thoreau, Wittgenstein, Kierkegaard, Basho, and endless others not as a critic or scholar only (I have venues for that), but as someone delighted and moved and pained by their words so aptly  addressed my way. I would write as one who recalls them at dusk and finds them again as day begins.*

On blogging, Ed mentions the following bloggers as influences:
- [Catlin Lowe](https://catlinlowe.wordpress.com/)
- [Kelly Dean Jolley](https://kellydeanjolley.com/)

# On his relationship with Thoreau

>So on through college and years teaching college he remained a high school sweetheart, a first love remembered well, but left behind as I moved on to — what shall I say — more _challenging_ writers. I learned from my philosophy profs that he was not a philosopher. And that was decades before I began to learn that you could be a philosopher who found philosophy in George Eliot, Dickinson... or Thoreau.
>
>In grad school, I actually _heard_ Cavell lecture on _Walden_. But I took his interest as quirky, a circus act...
>
>I knew all about him, and he was not where it was at; in the academy, that is: I could dream of him on long hikes in the Sierras. It was quite an accident that brought me to reopen Cavell-on-Thoreau well into my philosophical career, and to begin reading the _Journals_, and _A Week_, and _Cape Cod_, and with a bittersweet shock of recognition, realize what I had been missing all those years. I had never read a sentence of his slowly! Thinking I knew him when I didn’t at all. I’ve know him all my life, and I’ve just started to get to know him, or maybe... struggle and love as I will, I’ll never know him.
