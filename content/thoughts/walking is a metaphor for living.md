Living is an exploratory navigation of [[The geography of life]]. When I walk, I deepen my understanding and familiarity of the space I occupy: the universe, Earth, my country, my locale, the space I am currently standing or sitting on.

Asking and trying to answer questions like what is this space, what happens in it, is what living is all about.

The more I walk, the more I understand my reality. The more I  understand my reality and my relationship with it, the better I am able to act within appropriately.

To see the world, to experience it. Is living.

Maintenance work is still living. But what comes after maintenance is a different kind of livingâ€”flourishing. When we are [[walking]], we flourish.
