Ginhawa philosophical and poetic writing in Filipino (it makes sense to write this in Filipino make it very niche because it is very cultural and niche)

Reality-wise, I will be engaging with local thinkers. So I need to accept this. Even if I import foreign concepts and or build an international audience later on, it is still helpful to create something local.

This problem is also related to the following problems:

- [[Should I have one or multiple websites?]]
- [[Should I write in one language or multiple languages?]]
