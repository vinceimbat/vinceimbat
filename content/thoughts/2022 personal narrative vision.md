`I wake up in a clean, wide enough, and minimally furnished apartment. I have invested in just enough tools and furnitures to make this space the best I have ever lived in my 30 years of existence. The apartment is easy to maintain and I have instituted systems and habits that would protect it from pests and wear and tear. It is an affordable apartment, because Lea has helped me cover the costs and maintain it for the both of us.`

`My apartment is situated in a quiet neighborhood where people are friendly, considerate, and helpful.` `To build on this culture, I have proactively done my part as a good neighbor.` **I have given gifts to my neighbors whenever I can to continue nurturing the spirit of giving, peace, and friendship.**  `I have never had a single altercation with them. If some things upset me, I either let it pass or tell it to them in a respectful and considerate way personally.`

I love living in this space and so do the friends I have invited and hosted here. **I have transformed my simple abode into a welcoming home for the important people in my life—people who I invite for meaningful and transformational conversations and camaraderie.** Gone were the days when I wasn’t sure who to welcome into my life. **I have articulated clearly to myself what kind of people I want to bring into my life and my inner circle.** ==I have proactively sought after these people and nurtured my relationships with them.==

I have done the same with people who are doing a similar work to my life work. ==I am regularly conversing and connecting with people who are self-directed and autonomous thinkers who are also deeply grounded in the application of their beliefs into their daily lives and who are sharing their story beautifully. To maintain this engagement, I have established a habit of regularly searching for and reaching out to peers who do the work that I want to do in the space that I want to contribute to. I reach out to mentors, peers, and potential followers of my work regularly.==

`I had eight hours of sleep last night. I religiously sleep by 11 PM and wake up at 7 AM. I wake up with lots of physical and mental energy, owing to the fact that I have taken very good care of my mind and body.` I have established a healthy, sustainable, time-efficient, and cost-effective nutrition system that has worked wonders to my overall well-being. This system has completely healed my digestion and has improved my gut health, which translates into a sharper and happier brain. **My mental health has never been this great that I was strong enough to succeed in tapering my antidepressant further to 1/4 a pill a day.** I am full of hope that soon, I will be able to get off the pill forever.

`I was surprised to see that Lea has woken up earlier than me. We are now living together and this has done great wonders to her personal development. The environment of the apartment and my example has motivated her to make progress in two of the most difficult to handle areas of her life: her finances and her health.` I hear the soft, soothing sound of a flute behind the gentle voice of a yoga instructor. Lea is already downstairs doing her morning asanas. Lea has been doing yoga regularly, in congruence to other physical exercises she does. `She has been the most active she’s ever been while living here with me.` She has even encouraged me to add more physical activity to my walking, and I am glad to have responded. It just reinforced my other healthy habits. I am so grateful that our habits and lifestyles augment each other in a feedback loop.

My already wonderful relationship with Lea has deepen even more. `Whatever tiny thing we haven’t talked about, especially those that can be an issue, have been brought to the surface and processed. We have successfully made our relationship vibrant and exciting even if it is already our third year together.` I have supported her in her financial goal to save for an emergency fund that could support her and her dependents for three months of no work. `I have, likewise, continued to build relationships with Lea’s family, particularly Dan, who I have shared conversations and fun times with since he got home from Bahrain. I have continued to introduce her to my extended family and other friends, embedding ourselves further into our lives and communities.`

While Lea continued her asanas, I go down to do my pre-desk routine. I say hello to the cats and feed them. `Champy and Shorty have been in their best and healthiest form since I have adopted them.` **I have successfully transitioned them into an organic diet, which I prepare myself.** `They are already also speyed and I continue to provide for their other healthcare needs. While feeding them, I also remember Kako, my dog back in Pangasinan, whom I continue to send food allowance every month.` I remembered my scheduled trip to Pangasinan this weekend. `I have religiously gone home to Pangasinan to be with my parents every two months and I am scheduled to go to them. I have found ways to always give back to my parents who are already getting old by the day. We were also able to be reunited as a complete family ever since the pandemic started. We were able to bring Ate Mau and the kids to Pangasinan. When not in Pangasinan, I call to them at least once a month.`

`After finishing my pre-desk routine, I went inside my office to start my day. I started with a 15-minute meditation, wrote my 5MJ, processed any photos I took yesterday, and log my recent expenses. I then took my journal to free write in one to two pages.` In this particular journaling session, I reflect on the progress I have done in my financial life in recent months. I am grateful that **I was able to reevaluate my understanding, values, and general philosophy of money and the material world early this year. This reevaluation has allowed me to clearly articulate my financial philosphy and goals.** `I continue to earn 50k per month through Scribendi, which allows me to have enough time to work on my other projects and not compromise my health.` That said, `I have reevaluated my editing work and have come to a decision whether to improve my editing skills or look for a different line of work altogether. I have also reevaluated whether to continue with outsourcing my Scribendi work and have come to a decision that fits well with my general plan.` **I am also very thankful that I have finally found a second source of stable income**, which will serve as a buffer in case Scribendi orders are fewer than usual. Throughout the year, I have done an even better job managing my money. **I have researched and adjusted my investent portfolio to optimize it.** `I have allotted some money to put in high risk, high reward investment instruments that have worked well for me this year, and I have finally decided on what insurance to take. I have began making contributions to it. I am also wiser now in making purchases. I don’t make purchases abruptly. I have trained myself to wait as much as I can before I make a purchase so that I could gather enough information about what I buy.` **One of the best purchases I did this year was a new repairable and durable laptop that should last me many years to come. Through it, I have also explored Linux and opensource lifestyle that has helped me further cut costs in software.**

`After journaling, I started writing a daily review report. While writing, I felt good knowing that I have applied the system I created earlier this year many times and improved it further based on feedback from using it. My review system has worked wonders in terms of strengthening my recall and awareness of my progress, and it has helped me identify the best things to share to my audience.`

After writing the daily report, I started writing notes in my Talahardin. **My note-taking system has really matured. It has accumulated more than 300 quality notes that house all my most important ideas and personal knowledge. I have articulated my system using inspiration from Zettelkasten, Evergreen note-taking system, and BASB and have released a tutorial on how to create one for others.**

`The note-taking system has profoundly helped my thinking in many areas and has made studying really enjoyable.` This year, it helped me `develop my Sky Level, i.e., the articulation of my purpose, values, and the big picture vision for my life. Because I have articulated this for myself, it has been easier for me to make decisions and be more adventurous in trying things out, knowing that there are many ways towards my big picture vision.`

The Talahardin has also helped me accomplish my goal of doing **a survey of individuals who asked the question “How to Live?” I have studied how they study, live, share, connect, and facilitate their ideas to others.** `Because of my system, I have really gained more wisdom this year. That wisdom, in turn, has helped me experience more Ginhawa and positive emotions throughout this year.`

It has also helped me learn new skills and interests. **I am now quite adept in my understanding of design principles and I have applied that understanding in designing a website that houses the shareable artifacts of my creativity. I am also currently designing a writing app and system for my Talahardin.** To build my own designs myself, **I have also learned coding and software engineering. I have used that knowledge to build my website and to develop the Talahardin tool. I have achieved a competent level in all these areas that I am beginning to seriously consider transitioning into this kind of work as my new source of income.**

I am particularly proud of the wesbite. `The website has allowed me to share documentations of my projects and general life journey throughout this year. Through it, I have maintained connection with people who follow my work and have allowed me to meet other new people who are doing similar work.`

Through it, `I was able to share my other creative work—particularly my walk narratives that showcase my improved skills in storytelling in words, photography,` ==and videography.== I am particularly proud that `I have planned, undertaken, and written about at least one long philosophical walk this year. This walk has exposed me to new sceneries, which triggered new thoughts, and have enriched how I live.`

As I finish my note-taking session and reflect on all of these, I felt a deep sense of gratitude—gratitude for an entire year that has, once again, passed, and gratitude for a new one coming. The past year has not been immune to challenges, but I was able to go past it with this profound sense of accomplishment and contentment.

I got out of the office and went into the room, **opening my wardrobe, which I have curated well in the past year.** I chose a pair of clothes that suit me really well. I wore them and felt really good as I looked at the mirror. I went down and saw that Lea is now all dressed up.

Ready? She asked.

Ready. I answered.
