My forest garden of the mind is what I use to refer to the collection of contents of the mind, recorded in media or unrecorded, that I have actively and consciously collected, curated, and cultivated. Therefore, it includes my digital notes and documents, analog materials, and photos.

I use a forest garden as a metaphor to work with my metaphor of [[thoughts/wilderness]] and [[thoughts/walking]] as a metaphor for thinking and exploring mental spaces.

The metaphor is inspired by [[thoughts/digital gardening]], which involves a sense of ownership to place or at least a relationship between self and space.

My forest garden of the mind has a variety of species in it: [essays](tags/essays), [poems](tags/poems), [vignettes](tags/vignettes), and [[thoughts/photography|photographs]].

Walking (i.e., thinking) in the garden starts by collecting [[thoughts/seeds]] and continues with planting them, tending them until they become [[thoughts/seedlings]] and eventually [[thoughts/evergreens]]

Walking leads to the blazing of [[Trails]] between plants, which eventually makes creating a topography or map possible.

Exists in cyberspace but also includes text, information. But what is information. This is borderline the platonic realm, a realm beyond mind and matter.
