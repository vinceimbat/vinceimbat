My decision to include a daily review in [[thoughts/my workflow]] started in December 2021 when I realized that how I want to approach [[Sharing]] is tightly connected with how I conduct [[thoughts/review]]. Conducting a daily review by following [[thoughts/my daily review routine]] helps me track my progress in my [[thoughts/understanding]]. Writing the review also serves as a [[thoughts/spaced repetition]] practice that helps me remember what I learned. I also review my current projects, which sometimes are also learning projects. This was also the time when I realized that creating [[Reports]] based on my reviews helped me produce public versions that I can share to my audience.

The daily report produced during the daily review is the reference I use to write [[thoughts/monthly reports]], which are the culmination of [[thoughts/my monthly review routine]].
