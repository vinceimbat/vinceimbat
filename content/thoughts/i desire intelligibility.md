I need to stop trying to be unintelligible in my writing. This isn't who I am. I have sought truth, understanding, and clarity or so long, I haven't really developed a love for the ambiguous. I writing is the pursuit of being true to oneself—which it is!—then, by all means, include poetry and musicality and fragmentation in my writing. But I don't have to be excessively unintelligible.

The farthest I could go will be [[thoughts/annie dillard|Annie Dillard]] or [[thoughts/ocean vuong|Ocean Vuong's]] prose. But if I prefer to stay around [[thoughts/craig mod|Craig Mod]] or [[thoughts/ben hewitt|Ben Hewitt]] that's perfectly fine. I need to understand and be understood because for so long I haven't felt these two together. I have to be proud of my inclinations and be myself. I need to speak in my voice.
