My purpose is to live deliberately.

This entails the following:

>Every day, I want to deepen my friendship with the geography of life—the universe, others, and myself—so that I may respond to what the present moment asks from me appropriately and by doing so live a happy and meaningful life.

"I want" — I choose to live and not give up on life. I accept life's challenges and face them with grace.

"deepen my friendship with the geography of life" — I want to live a philosophical and contemplative life—to feel deeply curious and optimistic about it despite its inherent meaninglessness and chaotic nature.

"the universe, others, and myself" — This is the outward-looking part of my purpose inspired by [[thoughts/free religion|free religion]]. As I see the freedom of the self that I possess, I too recognize my interdependence with other beings.

"so that I may respond to what the present moment asks from me appropriately" — The purpose of philosophy and contemplation is to act better and appropriately.

"happy" — I want to achieve self-actualization. I want to savor life, feel that my days are longer, make the most out of every moment, and feel healthy and loved. In the words of [[thoughts/henry david thoreau|Henry David Thoreau]], "I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life."

"meaning" — I want to deepen my sense of existence, engage with deep truth, make the mundane sacred, and most importantly, be relevant to the lives of people I care deeply about.

A different way to express my purpose is "to self-actualize and transcend." [[thoughts/happiness|Happiness]] is closer to what [[thoughts/self-actualization|self-actualization]] generates, while [[thoughts/meaning|meaning]] is what [[thoughts/transcendence|transcendence]] is all about.

This [[thoughts/purpose|purpose]] came from a line of thought I detailed in [[thoughts/my quest|my quest]]. It was also inspired by an initial reading of [[thoughts/the inward morning by bugbee|The Inward Morning by Bugbee]] and Thoreau's purpose written in [[thoughts/walden by thoreau|Walden]]:

>"I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation, unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life."
