- [[thoughts/queer art vs straight art|Queer art vs straight art]]

Notes from Butiki Baboy

Queer art vs not queer

Queer
- streams of consciousness, playful (problematic because some straight people do so)
- more experimental
- Andaming pinanggalingan vs straight na medyo careless and walang pake sa reception

Straight
- like orgasm yung text

An AI art did not take risk. I am not excited by an art does that not take risks.

Consciously making free time for important stuff.

I don't think I'll ever be able to remove the pastor in me. While I will explore writing in different ways, I have something unique in me. A unique value proposition. Use my past as a pastor to walk and see the world in a different set of eyes.
