Here's a bottom-up approach to discovering your [[thoughts/purpose|purpose]].

I am partial to the idea that when we were born, we didn't have a given purpose ([[thoughts/there is no destiny|there is no destiny]]). Even if there was one, we were not aware of it. My intuition tells me that it was tiny decisions I made along the way from childhood to adulthood that determined what we I am interested about at the current moment. We try different things out and take note of what resonated to us and what didn't ([[convergence–divergence model of creativity]]).

However, trying different things out produce too much information and magnets of attention that could easily produce overwhelm. We need a certain tool—a purpose or a question—to make sense of all these information. This means that a purpose is simply a narrowing tool that gives us a sense of control and direction.

Realizing that purpose is simply a convergence tool implies that you can [[find your purpose through divergence–convergence]]. This method applies to thinking about the purpose of your life as well as the purpose of your smaller projects.
