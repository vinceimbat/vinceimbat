A story has several elements. Knowing about these elements is useful in appreciating stories as well as analyzing and creating them. The following elements are

1. Structural elements (acts, scene sequences, scenes, beats)
2. Elements of plot (changes in value charge, frameworks, resolution, introduction of the protagonist’s weakness
3. Elements of character (backstory, values, actions in the story, relationships)
4. Leading question and theme (questions about the nature of the world)
5. Symbols
6. World-building

To identify these units of a story, one needs practice and a level of competence. A similar process is needed in analyzing theoretical knowledge ([[Six types of knowledge]]).
