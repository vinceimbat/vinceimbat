The soul vs the self is a way to talk about the right brain left brain.

See [[thoughts/edward mooney|Edward Mooney]] on this.

My stand is that the self and the soul complement each other. There is no need to get pit them against each other. That said, there is indeed a danger of letting one mode dominate the other. That is why they shouldn't be pitted. Focus on making them work together.

But I understand Mooney here. Being an existentialist, he is partial that for the big questions it is hollow. Indeed it seems to be the case and we have very limited answers for the big questions. Therefore, focus on what we know, what we are sure of. The little things. The day to day realities.
