My intellectual history can be divided into four periods:

1. [[The JW period of my intellectual life]]
2. [[The humanist period of my intellectual life (2011-2014)]]
3. [[The Eastern philosophy period of my intellectual life (2015â€“2017)]]
4. [[The rational period of my intellectual life (2017-]]

For a quick summary, here is [[my conversion process]].
