There is no measure of religiosity that can change myself to who I want to become unless I am intentional about it. Religiosity is about training the mind and perhaps even the body. It leads to habits and routines. The ideas behind these habits and routines is that they, hopefully, will bring change in one's behavior. But these changes need to be what is needed by the specific person, thus the need for a really personal religion.
