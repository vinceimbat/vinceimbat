"What I found early in my career was that there are two different ways to do philosophy, at least the kind of philosophy I do, which is analytic philosophy. One is to focus very hard on the steps in an argument when you are trying to assess whether or not it is a good argument. But there's another way to do philosophy, which is to try to relax and let your mind wander and be surprised by the associations that you get."

"I often came of a topic. Sometimes a topic sprang into my mind when I started walking and I just followed my thinking and then wrote notes when I got home and that's pretty much how the book evolved.""What I found early in my career was that there are two different ways to do philosophy, at least the kind of philosophy I do, which is analytic philosophy.
