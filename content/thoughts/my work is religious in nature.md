My work has some pastoral elements in it. My calling, my gift, is to remind people and to call them toward their state of depth. In a way, I'm a pastor of free religion—a religion that starts within me first. One of the things I want to do is eventually help people one-on-one—a life of retreat and communion, of going back to my well but going out to help others. I want to build a purely naturalistic belief system then from there, get out and have an adventure into the wilderness of compassion.

Malalim ang hugot ko sa paglalakad, pagsusulat, at paglikha. Kailangan kong yakapin ito ng buong-buo at huwag mahiya. Bagkus, magpakatotoo. Mula sa feedback sa ANWW20, sa tingin ko pinaka-nakaresonate sila sa religious o spiritual element ng essay ko. Isa itong void sa Philippine literature: sincere religious writings. Since tanggap ko naman na religious ang writings ko (at lahat ng ginagawa ko), paninindigan ko na ito.
