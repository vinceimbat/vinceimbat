When drawing comics after a very long time, I noticed that there is a difference between the work I produce when I second guess myself and when I think about it in my mind and just draw it spontaneously. In other words: practicing in my mind vs. practicing on paper.

When I practice on paper and they try to imitate that on the panel, the result is subpar. On the other hand, when I allow the spontaneity of art, I like the product more.

This spontaneity, this directness, this is what I want to cultivate in my drawing practice. The release that comes from thinking and doing "immediately" with no strong pressure to perform is art in its purest form.
