# On Present as Prologue

What does Olson mean? I think he is proposing directness. Aesthetics can become somewhat a layer over what we truly want to express. Our words, written or spoken, flow on the same plane as our actions, thoughts. If all of these flow in that plane of authenticity, why should we aspire beautification? I mean, beautification is ok as long as it is honest, earnest, and true and does not hinder truth and goodness. It shouldn't fool us and hide what is underneath.
