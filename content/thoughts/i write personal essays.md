My choice of writing genre is [[Creative nonfiction]], specifically the [[Personal essay]].

This means that I try to write autobiographically and poetically even if I talk about philosophy and other sophisticated ideas. For example, I use a [[inbox/Vignette]] to share a philosophical lesson, or I talk about philosophy without mentioning it. Instead, I focus on the questions.

I don’t want to remove the “I” from what I am trying to do: understanding the universe and my place in it.

This is the reason why I don’t see myself as a researcher per se. [[I am a writer with a strong research foundation]].

A tension with this way of writing though is imminent between ideas and the writer’s story. Other writers, like [James Clear](craftdocs://open?blockId=A0914B11-A194-472A-9116-E349DEA7B254&spaceId=63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8) or [[Malcolm Gladwell]], have almost entirely removed themselves from their writing. They want ideas to take center stage.

The reason why I want to use personal essays rather tan pure essays is that I want to emphasize the search and I want to avoid talking about ideas from an elevated position.

Having said that, I actually want to try different genres. I don’t want to be locked in a single way of writing or topic.

Also, I want to write about my life, but I want to do it not in this “I am perfect” way, but in a discreet, honest, and imperfect way.

Another way of articulating the kind of writing I want to do is writing about the inner world and outer world—terms I first encountered from [[Pico Iyer]].

# Update this with new insights

I am committing to writing [[thoughts/lyric essay|lyric essays]] that are philosophical in nature, specifically [[thoughts/existentialism|existential]] in nature (i.e., [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy|lyrical philosophy]]), which are generated through walking.

This commitment should focus my reading.

Methodology: walking
Subject: existentialism
Form: hybrid lyric essay with photography

My reading list should include the following:
- walking literature
- existential literature
- lyric essays
- hybrid essays (with photographs)
