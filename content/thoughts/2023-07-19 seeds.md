I wonder if I should spend time writing newsletters on the process of creating a book or just write a newsletter about my life as a whole.

Is there a way I could revive Uman?

You can experiment as you should, but you know what you need and want to do, and there is a large gap in Filipino literature that it fills:

Sincere, earnest, spiritual writing with walking as method. Find models for this pilgrimage.

Philosophy first before method. Thinking first before writing.

There is so much material in the past. What will u do with it?

Focus on being a good person. Just happens that art makes you a good person. Helps a lot. You don't want to do art to be good at it but to be a good person.
