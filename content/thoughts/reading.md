Note: Don't stress too much about what to read next. Let your curiosity and needs dictate that. As long as there's at least 1 prose book and 1 poetry book on your plate you'll be fine. Focus more on making good use of the information you get from your reading.

Reading is such an important part of my [[thoughts/understanding]] process, specifically, the [[thoughts/my studying process]].

My reading process follows classic [[getting things done]] method:

1. Collect: I [[Use a reading inbox to capture useful reading materials]]. I am mindful in adding materials here, though. I follow some [[Guidelines on what to add to your reading inbox]].
3. Process: For a detailed presentation, see [[How to manage a reading inbox]]. I review my reading inbox weekly as part of [[lms/my weekly review routine]] to delete materials that I will no longer read. The materials I do read, especially those for learning ([[Decide whether to read for fun or for learning]]), are read with the intention of taking notes ([[Reading without note-taking is only beneficial in the short-term]])
4. Organize: I archive everything I read. I detailed how I do archiving for each reading material type in the note detailing the implementation of [[My reading inbox]].
