# *01 - Knowing Your Why Or Overarching Theme*

**Choices**

1. Renaissance Business
2. Separate Businesses
3. ::Hybrid Approach::

**Work Models**

1. ::Group Hug (Renaissance Business)::
2. ::Slash::
3. Einstein
4. Sequential

I’ll go with the Hybrid approach.

My work model is a combination of Group Hug and Slash.

I need something to make income immediately (freelance writing).

Freelance writing is like my Wellspring Day Job because it feeds my passion for writing.

This freelance business funds my other unpaid projects (books, blog, adventures, and other passions).

My ideal audience for my freelancing and my other unpaid projects are the same - united by certain psychographics.

My audience are people and organizations who are spiritual, creative, and service driven. They have a humanitarian purpose.

**My Brand Equation**

Inner Work -> Outer Work + Social Change

Try: Branding as not something you do to yourself. But simply your way of communicating the value that people get.

Communicate your value, your why, your mission statement so that people will join you.

An overarching theme is just one form of “why"

Why = value, philosophy, driving force

Try to become the adulterated you in your website

You need: money, meaning, and variety

Systems Thinker = Multiple businesses

Brand yourself as someone who can do different thing

Look at branding as an online representation of what you are all about

# *02 - Communicating Your Why Through Story*

Experiment: Try changing your offerings once a while

Your website is your home in the web. Make it fun.

Creative Agency

Introductions - Don’t tell everything you do. Trim it a bit depending on context.

The Briefcase Technique

Pull out little pieces of your personality and story and work it into copy, site, and design.

Orient your brand story on audience

Brand story = Your values + Your audience’s values (overlap and connection points)

Steps

1. Who do I want to work with? Who is the audience that I want to share values with?
2. Make a list of the attributes and qualities of your ideal audience.
3. Formulate materials around it (colors, design, story)

Branding = about you & your experience + about your audience & your vision for them

Don’t be someone you are not.

Find your youest you.

How can you express your individuality and find the overlap with customers that actually need your thing?

What do you know about your audience?

When you’ve worked with people who really got you, what were they like?

- Humble
- Kind

What values do they have, that your audience also has?

What’s the opposite of your ideal audience?

- Business-y

Who do you really not want to work with?

**What I want to tell them about myself**

**Shared values**

**What they care about**

Spiritual

Creative

Service-oriented

# *03 - Communicating Your Why Through Design*
