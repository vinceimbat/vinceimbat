Writing blog posts is a midway vehicle between writing notes via [[thoughts/zettelkasten|zettelkasten]] or [[talahardin|talahardin]], and writing a book. A book often requires you to have a “final answer”. But you are working on a really large problem that requires complicated answers that evolve through time. To force yourself to write a book is premature.

I noticed this with [[thoughts/steve patterson|Steve Patterson]] . He is such a careful thinker that he doesn't produce a lot of content. If he isn't ready, he doesn't force it. His book *[[literature/square one by patterson|Square One]]* is his final answer to epistemic problems. I don't expect it to change anytime soon. But his ideas on metaphysics as well as health won't be written into books just yet. He publishes blog posts on metaphysics and changes his mind along the way. He does this in his blog. I don't think he'll do it in a book.
