Here's a simple financial plan I thought of after reading [[thoughts/the millionaire fastlane by de marco|The Millionaire Fastlane by MJ De Marco]].

By 40 years old, I am retired. Earlier than this will be a bonus. The plan is as follows:

1. Establish a source of income to support me while I build a business. This could either be a day job (part-time or full-time) or gigs.
2. Establish a business that would support both my lifestyle and my nest egg.
3. Invest the nest egg and let it grow to buy my freedom.
