We give doctors too much trust. They do not ask us of our patient history enough. They aren't concerned enough. There's no mutual helping relationship. And we accept all that they say as the conclusive, authoritative, answer to our problems. While there are parts of medicine where specialized training is required, there is also a large part of it that is debated and swayed by dogma. There is a lot of room for [[self-reliance|self-reliance]] in health. The only question is how much self-reliance is good? And how should it be used correctly?

# To dos
- Look for books that teach patients to be empowered stakeholders of their health.
