Poetry is about being as intentional as one can be with one's words. Being economical. Minimalistic. About how one can transmit meaning with as little tools as one can.

I think thall all writers ought to be poets or at least try to be one.

Essays on the other hand are where we try. Where we can be more free.

Genreless writing is of course not concerned about these genres. It is about freedom.

Green Fission

Light
from a lamp post
hits leaves
bursting
a supernova of green
that disappears
in the darkness
between me
and this tree.

Experiment with alternative texts

If Louise said to catch a photo as you see it. Perhaps you can do the same with text. Catch an image in text as you saw it.
