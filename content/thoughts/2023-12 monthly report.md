# Summary

This month, Lea and I joined Uwa, Abbey, and their dogs in the Makiling Challenge pet marathon. That morning was hands down one of the best mornings of my life. From the moment we arrived around six until we left about eight in the morning, the smile on my face never faded.

From December 4 to 10, 2023, I finally did a week-long walk around Los Ba単os, which I called Roots x Gravel. I walked for six days, taking a day off on December 6. Ultimately, I took 114,814 steps to cover 72.59 kilometers, including 87 streets in 13 barangays. The walk was a step forward on my project to write a book about Los Ba単os. It also helped me improve my writing, photography, and walking.

Roots x Gravel improved my patience when sharing the road with other pedestrians and motorists, something I've always found difficult, inspiring me to articulate [[thoughts/some rules on sharing the road with others|some rules on sharing the road with others]].

About two weeks after the project ended, I published an essay about my first solo walk of Bagong Silang last November 2023. That essay was entitled "[[essays/and i shall hear their hearts beating|And I Shall Hear Their Hearts Beating]]."

Roots x Gravel helped me return photography, practice the craft, and rethink my systems. With my photo library growing because of these walks, a photo backup system should be in place. I invested in a 2TB Sandisk external SSD to serve as the primary storage of my photo archive. I then backed this archive up in the cloud through my Backblaze account.

Next, I invested several hours going through my existing photographs, culling the albums, adding metadata, adding keywords, adding GPS coordinates, and renaming the best ones. While doing these, I had to return to photographs I took last year during [[essays/a never-ending walk|my long walk from Los Ba単os to San Pablo]]. Returning to these photographs, I noticed, was almost like re-walking that route.

I also spent a significant chunk of my December in dialogue with Jesa regarding our project. In our dialogue, I had to confront my ignorance of the gender lens, respond to her emails with grace, and write about what I know as well as what I'm still working on regarding my knowledge of walking as a writing method.

I also spent the last week before Christmas reading and studying [[literature/things become other things mod|TBOT by Craig Mod]].

Lastly, I traveled with friends to visit Maui and Yano at San Pascual, to walk around the town, and come in dialogue about our lives. Then, Lea and I spent New Year's Eve with Embi and Bevs and new friends Carl and his wife MC.
