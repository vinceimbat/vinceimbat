Religion, like class, gender, ethnicity, and disability is a social category. Like these categories, there are religious identities that are more popular and therefore hold more power, while some are considered minorities. For example, Muslims are a religious minority in Myanmar and suffered under the hands of the more powerful Buddhist majority.

Anyone who supports inclusion in the aforementioned social categories should also consider how they can be sensitive in the religious identities of the people around them.

Some notes on practicing religious inclusivity.

- Never assume the religious identity of other people. Ask them about it and be curious.
- Avoid imposing your religious practices on others (e.g. using your way of praying when you're sure that people around don't share your faith). It's better to ask them if they're ok about it before saying your prayer.
- Even if you feel strongly about the need to evangelize, respect other people's desire not to be preached about.
- Don't equate religion to goodness. Even religious people can cause suffering towar others and even irreligious people can be compassionate.
- Support interfaith
- Understand that some people can have complex religious identities and this is okay.
- Be aware that many individuals can still be religious and spiritual despite their rejection of a God.
