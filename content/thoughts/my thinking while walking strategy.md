Walk at a set time every day (or as often as possible).

Practice mindfulness: Look around or simply look at the ground while walking. Alternate between these modes.

Take photographs when appropriate.

Capture inklings as they come. Write them under a subheading in the daily note: Field notes.

Rest when necessary or pause to write inklings.

Engage with people when there is an opportunity but prioritize thinking and listening to yourself.

In the following day, during your [[My daily routine]].
