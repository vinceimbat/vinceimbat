# A More Intricate Financial System for Both of Us

Thesis: Although we have made significant changes to make us work more as a team, there are larger moves we can make to support each other's goals and align our lives.

Vince's main goal: To have as much freedom (time and mental space) as possible to pursue philosophy, contemplation, and creative pursuits.

Lea's goals (?):
1. To transition toward a dream career.
2. To provide to loved ones.
3. To have a more secure financial life.

**1. Combined Emergency Funds**

I will combine my emergency fund (Php 192,000) with your emergency fund (Php 31,336.24) to make a current total of Php 223,336.24. Moving forward we would both attempt to save a combined EF of Php 564,000 (V = Phph 324,000; L = Php 240,000). This amount could support both of us for 12 months without work. We will keep half of it (Php 282,000) in a high-interest savings account and the other half in a time deposit that we renew every 6 months. We will allot a specific amount of money from our monthly CF budget to go to this (around Php 3,000 per month, could be less but more is obviously better). We will replenish it whenever it is used. We will not put our money in other places (i.e., invest) unless this fund is full or replenished.

Implications
- Since we currently have almost half of our EF goal, you (L) can relax in saving for an EF, which means you can consider giving money to your family (even if small) right now.

**2. Shared Investment Funds**

I currently have the following investments:
- USD 3,561.03 in the US stock market (Php 195,856.65 current exchange).
- Php 17,715.64 in the PH stock market
- Php 70,000 in Pag-ibig MP2
- Php 10,000 in crypto

Total: Php 293,572.29

I am willing to share this as our "common wealth" to use either to fill up our EF or save for future long-term goals primarily retirement but also short-term goals like getting married, etc.

Right now, I am simply waiting for my US stocks to recuperate from a loss. After I regain the loss, I am planning to divert majority of our funds to our EF and more secure investments like Pag-ibig MP2.

**3. Combined Major Budget Categories**

We will now add the following budget categories into our CF.
- Insurance
- HMO
- Medical and dental care
- Gadget replacement
- Netflix

(Note: For your November 2023 insurance contribution, take it from your own money first. Do this as well with your HMO. But moving forward, we will save for these expenses together in our CF.)

As our lives even become more entangled, more budget categories will move from our individual funds to our CF.

**4. Vince's Request or Subsidy**

My main dream in life is very simple: to spend most of my days (before I die) engaged in philosophy, contemplation, and creative projects. Eventually, I might include helping others via counselling or coaching or something aligned to this. I am now convinced that this is my calling. It gives meaning to my life and is what sustains me.

I think part of what causes my current depressive feelings, aside from the things I shared to you, is that my 2023 was a year where I had to put my calling on the side to focus on making and managing my money.

What I am feeling right now is that I want to be very careful to get back to earning the same amount I used to earn lest I compromise my calling.

My goal is still to return to earning a reasonable amount of income monthly (max. 30k per month) so I could contribute to our CF and have at least 5k to contribute to our savings per month.

However, I don't want to take on a full-time job and I want to earn just enough (not more), so I don't have to spend more time working.

To help me achieve my main goal, I am trying to get better at editing and proofreading. In time (perhaps in another month or two), I'll be ready to re-apply at editing agencies that give me the flexibility I used to have. I am also considering waiting for Bookbright in case they could offer me a part-time job.

In addition to this, I am also very much willing to live as simple as I can to incur very little financial overhead.

But for me to pursue my calling while slowly building my income up, I wonder if you could subsidize my monthly CF contribution to atleast Php 10k until I achieve my income goal.

This will help me to relax and focus on what matters most.

In return (aside from the things I mentioned above), I'll be focusing on helping you build your career and life systems moving forward as I explain below.

**5. Vince's Closer Support to Lea's Life and Career**

Things I could do for you in the coming months:
- Build your LMS for free.
- Return to doing the majority of household chores (75-80%, specifics TBD and negotiated).
- Help build your ideal career and business
	- help identify what you want to do
	- create a flexible plan for your life and business in the coming months
	- set up business systems
	- fix registrations etc.
	- learn your work and substitute when necessary
	- build your website for free (including your portfolio)
	- help with marketing
	- assist you in planning and growing your business or work no matter where you want it to go

My mornings will remain sacred. But I will do these in the afternoon and early evenings. I could also do them during my late mornings when necessary.
