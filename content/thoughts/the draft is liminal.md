The essence of a [[thoughts/draft|draft]] is that [[thoughts/art is never finished|it is never finished]]. This being "in process" is what gives a draft its value. Because a draft is perpetually in transit, working with drafts works well with [[thoughts/walking|walking]]. In fact, I would say that a walking methodology necessitates seeing one's body of work as a perpetual draft.

>In other words, what is valued as manuscript—and even more so the draft not the fair copy—is that it remains in process. It is perhaps the “in-process” and serial quality that ultimately defines the modern literary draft and endows it with auratic value, whether that draft has been produced as a handwritten manuscript, typescript, or digital .doc.
