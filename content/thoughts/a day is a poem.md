The day is like a poem. The form can be the sameâ€”same routines, schedules, and habits. But the stability and predictability of that form permits the courage in trying to get out of the norm. [[thoughts/billy collins|Billy Collins]] and [[thoughts/rofel brion|Rofel Brion]] did this. But we could never describe their poems as boring.
