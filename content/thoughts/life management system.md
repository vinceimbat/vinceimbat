A life management system is a consolidation of conceptual and physical structures that help an individual embrace [[thoughts/intentional living]]. The structures of a life management system are primarily conceptual (i.e., they exist first in the mind). However, since [[Action occurs in an external objective physical world]], physical structures are needed to extend and realize the conceptual structures.

Although these structures can easily become complex, their sole purpose is simply to accomplish [[thoughts/the core process of intentional living]]. To live intentionally, one needs to set intentions, effectively manage one's actions, and make sure that one’s actions are aligned with one’s intentions. These requirements are fulfilled by a life management system.

[[Every human being has a life management system]] whether they are aware of it or not. But [[thoughts/intentional living]] requires that one's life management system is more consciously maintained and optimized. While optimization is desirable, a life management system shouldn't be too complex that it can no longer do the two most important things it should do:

- [[A life management system should free your mind]]
- [[Build a life management system that helps you take intentional action]]

One cannot immediately create [[an optimized life management system]]. A more realistic starting point is a [[Minimum viable life management system]] that can be iterated and optimized through time. Ideally, a life management system should be an accurate system of managing actions grounded on sound philosophy. And because of this, it is more than just a consolidation of life hacks and productivity tips. It should be a reflection of one’s worldview and life philosophy (see [[Theory vs philosophy of living vs life management system]]).

A system has to be put in place whether or not there are inputs so that when inputs do come, one is ready. This principle involves performing regular [[Review]] even if there are only a few things to review.

Most Lms are prescriptive and autobiographical. To avoid this, we have to use generalities and tautologies in designing LMS.
