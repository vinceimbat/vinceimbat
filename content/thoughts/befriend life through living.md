A life is befriended through living it and telling stories about it, elevating, trying to make meaning out of it. In short, art. Life is befriended through art.

Though experiment:

Imagine I was born this day.
Inside a room.
Imagine I was born conscious, able to walk.
Imagine, it was here when I realized that life is inherently meaningless.
Death thru my own hands makes the most sense.

But instead of death, I decided to befriend life. I befriend life by living it.
And living is action, movement.
I befriend life by moving.
And reject death, inaction.

We befriend life by moving, choosing to live, continuing even if to stop is a lot easier. Like we befriend a place by moving. Walking. Kissing it through our feet.
