I pass by it but I rarely notice Molawin Biopark. Now that I've read about the origins of the garden, I wonder what this place was stripped of all its modern identities. Did anyone own it? What could I have found on the river from this vantage point? We call it a park, but the cicadas I hear now don't care.
