Here are my criteria for choosing a field:

1. The field has to have enough people working on it that can become potential [[Mentor]]s and peers (see [[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]]).
2. The field should have people engaged in activities similar to the [[Five areas of my life work]].
3. The potential mentors and peers in my field should be working on topics and questions that are related to my research questions and objectives (e.g., [[thoughts/how should I live?]], [[thoughts/how to live]], building a philosophy of life, etc.).
4. They have to be engaged in actual, real-life application of the knowledge they produce from their intellectual activity. They have to have a [[inbox/Practice]].
5. The field has to feel like it is balanced in the attention it gives to theory and practice. People here are engaged in activities that resemble [[thoughts/use-inspired basic research]].
6. The field has to have publication channels established, which also implies that it has an audience I can tap when I am ready (see [[Cautious sharing process]]).
7. This isn't the most important but it would make things a lot easier: the community has to be likable.

Using these criteria, I have decided that [[My field is practical philosophy]]. Having said that, I continue to ask, [[Do I really need a field?]]
