English is the language I write most on. Even my journals and private diaries are written in English. This is weird because I should be writing in [[thoughts/pangasinan|Pangasinan]] because it is my first language and the closest to me. And yet, I don't feel comfortable writing my deepest thoughts in Pangasinan. Pangasinan for me is a spoken language. It's something we don't write with. Of course, my use of English over the other two languages is explained simply by colonization.

When I reached the age when I started appreciating writing as a craft, seeing that I have some talent in it, I could've chosen between English or Filipino. English was the obvious choice.
