# Past year questions
## List your 3 top wins for these six months

1. I was able to manage my tinnitus to the point where I am habituating enough to be functional.
2. I was able to manage my health and finances relatively well during the tough lockdown.
3. My relationship with Lea has progressed in the past months even when we’re away from each other.

## What are the biggest lessons you’ve learned these six months?

1. I learned that happiness is a habit that needs to be nurtured and cultured every day.
2. It is possible to live a happy life even with Tinnitus.
3. I can optimize the systems around me so that I can be more free creatively.

## What were the risks you took?

1. I reached out with Lea and tried to see if it was possible to get back together even if I wasn’t sure she’ll accept me again and if things will work out well.
2. (Note) I am still playing it safe. I haven’t been challenging myself enough.

## What was your most loving service?

1. I tried my best to become more loving of my relationships - to let go of small misunderstandings, to forgive when needed, to try to resolve problems even if I still failed.

## What is your unfinished business from these six months?

1. Organizing my life in such a way that inspires creativity, accountability, and dreaming “bigger”.

## What are you most happy about completing?

1. I was most happy about completing Tungko. I was able to survive the lockdown because of the community. I was able to navigate different emotions because of the course. My relationship with Rem “improved” in a sense that we were able to navigate tough waters of disagreement. I also realize how much I prefer self-directed learning because of the course.

## Who were the three people that had the greatest impact on your life these six months?

1. Lea
2. Laurie Santos
3. Tiago Forte

## What was your biggest surprise?

1. Discovering Tiago Forte serendipitously, like all the other people who have shaped my thinking.

## What compliment would you liked to have received? Given?

1. Actually, I did receive a compliment I didn’t know I actually want to hear: That I am someone with a mix of humor and intelligence. I really like that. I want to embody that from now on.
2. I would like to give Lea more compliments. I think I need to do that more often. I have told her, “I am proud of her,” and I did mention recently how grateful I am for having an intelligent, kind, and beautiful girlfriend, but I need to do it more often.
3. I have complimented Rem many times this past months. I’ll see how I can give more compliments to my friends.

## What else do you need to do or say to be complete with these six months?

1. Since this is a mid-year review, I don’t feel compelled answering this question. There are a lot of incomplete things I want to complete moving forward.

## What one word or phrase best sums up and describes your experience this six months?

1. Patience

## What stories from the last six months are you letting go of?

1. I am letting go of the story that I need to stay at Sta. Maria to be happy, that I can’t live alone by myself, that I can’t find happiness within me, that I need my parents to cope with my problems.
2. I am letting go of the story that I need my family to be the way I want them to be. I am accepting where we are right now, and I won’t stress myself trying to piece our family together. I will continue to perform my duties as a son and brother, but will focus on my own life and my plans for building my own family in the future.
3. I am letting go of the story of frameworks and systems that I have been using since I started my personal development journey. I am now embracing new ways of organizing my actions and my goals through Tiago.
4. I am letting go of the story of playing it safe, of not challenging myself enough, because I am being called to show up and contribute to a community. I am letting go of the idea that I am a lesser human being after the depression. I am better, way better than that person I was in the past!
5. I am letting go of the story that I need to hide who I am to be part of communities and that I need these communities in the first place. I am braver to let go of communities that may have resonated to me at one point but no longer. Ginhawa and Zen are in mind. I will still connect with them once in a while. But my time is better spent building connections with communities that nurture my true self more.
