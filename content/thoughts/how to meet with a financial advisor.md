Before meeting:
- Know [[How much insurance coverage do you need?]]

During the meeting:
- Bring your notes.
- Be transparent.
- Let them know of other policies you have, your investments.
- Let them know how much you can afford to pay every month or year.
- Let them know of your medical history, your family's medical history.
- Ask questions.
- If you don't like how you are treated, look for another advisor to represent you on the same policy.

After the meeting:
- Don't be pressured to sign immediately when you meet.
- If they pressure you, they are not financial advisors. They are just agents trying to get a quota.
- Look for one or two companies to compare the policies from.
- Avoid aggressive VULs.
