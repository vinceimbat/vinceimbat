Perhaps how we breath affects our thoughts while we write them. Perhaps better thoughts could be born out of better breathing.

# Words from Miki Nakura

Do not think of result. The purpose of seiza is become a person of lower belly. A person of lower belly is a peaceful person.

The seiza posture is an independent posture. Our body and mind is closely related.

Stop exhaling at the point of 80%.

Practice concaving upper belly. You will see later you can put power in lower belly.
