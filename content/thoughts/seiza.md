Perhaps how we breath affects our thoughts while we write them. Perhaps better thoughts could be born out of better breathing.

# Words from Miki Nakura

Do not think of result. The purpose of seiza is become a person of lower belly. A person of lower belly is a peaceful person.

The seiza posture is an independent posture. Our body and mind is closely related.

Stop exhaling at the point of 80%.

Practice concaving upper belly. You will see later you can put power in lower belly.

Rapara (upper belly)
Sitapara (lower belly)
Tanden

Subtle difference of zazen and seiza is dropping the solar plexus.

zazen is very self-power position (I must experience satori with my self-power).

Heso = navel should face heaven (up)
