If any, what do the puddles say?

The wilderness of the soul may not be that undiscovered part but that part forgotten, left for something thought better.

Is the container of mental things a mental thing? It can't can it be? It has to be something different? What if the I is platonic and I have accessed of it all along?

Or is the self snapshots? If the I are snapshots and they are relational, then it makes sense that the I is collective.

Even crumbs of wood on the road have a presence.

Why do I feel a stronger pull towards people I've been physically around with? Distance, physics, matter matter.

The reflection of sunset walked with me on the puddle.

The soul vs the self is a way to talk about the right brain left brain.
