The annual review is designed to work in unison with the [[monthly review|monthly review]], [[weekly review|weekly review]], and [[thoughts/daily review|daily review]]. [[thoughts/annual reports|Annual reports]] can only be created if [[thoughts/monthly reports|monthly reports]] for each year are religiously produced through consistent daily and weekly reviews.

An annual report is one of the products of the annual review. It is an aggregate of monthly reports and other data unique to the annual review. The purpose of the annual report is to help write the [[thoughts/annual review article|annual review article]].
