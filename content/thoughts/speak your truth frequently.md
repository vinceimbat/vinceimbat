This is the reason why I canâ€™t be totally like [[Andy Matuschak]], who prioritizes insight over everything else. Although insight is important, equally important to me is self-expression. And there is no better way to get better at self-expression than practicing it as often as I can, preferably in a regular basis, ideally daily.

Therefore, while writing notes during [[thoughts/my morning writing practice]], I also continue to hone my creative writing skills through writing a [[Yesterday, I]] posts every day whenever I can.

[[I am a writer with a strong research foundation]]. That's two things in one. Both writing and research deserves enough attention.
