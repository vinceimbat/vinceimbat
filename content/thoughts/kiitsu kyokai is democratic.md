[[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] thought that democracy is what would protect the individuality and freedom, which is perhaps the most important thing that people owned within the [[kiitsu kyokai]], as they practice their faith with others. To keep the kiitsu kyokai democratic, he advocated for congregationalism and layman-ism, which meant that members were encouraged to lead worships and sermons. He also mentioned that the kiitsu kyokai follows the nonhierarchical structure of Quakers, where the church is not owned by a clergy but by its members.
