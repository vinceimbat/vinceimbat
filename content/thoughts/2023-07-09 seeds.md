The concepts of religion and spirituality are too hard for me to understand.

What I do understand is a concept that I think is the core of both: valuing.

I value the fact that I am alive and so I express gratefulness.

I value this bird and so I write a poem about it.

Others won't always feel this although everyone can access this feeling.

Value is what inspired our ancestors to create songs about rivers, mountains, landscapes.

If I build a website business, it will take more time. Same with editing.

So the right method is: either find a trad job or apply to an agency.
