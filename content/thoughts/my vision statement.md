I am [[thoughts/living|living]] my life deliberately by continuously acting according to my [[thoughts/intention|intentions]]. My intentions and [[thoughts/action|actions]] are informed by a deep and honest [[thoughts/understanding|understanding]] of realityâ€”the universe, others, and myself.

Every day, I try to "suck all the marrow out of life" through a pursuit of [[thoughts/beauty|beauty]], [[thoughts/meaning|meaning]], and [[thoughts/wisdom|wisdom]]. In this quest, I use [[walking|walking]] as a platform for understanding and [[thoughts/creating|creating]] for myself and others. I take photographs, catch [[thoughts/poetry|poetry]], and write notes that I combine into beautiful essays and books that I hope inspire others to also live deliberately.

To support myself in [[thoughts/my quest|my quest]], I take care of my mind and body so that I'm always at my best state moment by moment. Mindful that my actions always affect others, I practice [[thoughts/compassion|compassion]] and strive to always deepen my connection with fellow humans and other sentient beings.

I have also mastered my relationship with the material world. I support myself through meaningful work, use resources efficiently, and limit my interaction with the exchange economy by developing [[thoughts/self-reliance|self-reliance]].
