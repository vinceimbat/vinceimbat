You are returning to time.
Life incident.
Objective events and feelings about it.

Intentions
- What is your experience of the place now?
- Do you have initial ideas on how to approach it?
- Or is it open?

Balance short-term or long-term.

Focus on the design of experience.

Will fictionalizing memories be good for this project if my intention is to heal?

Mindfulness lens
- Thoughts are not facts.

What is the way to step back to see the thoughts that arise and we're there as a witness to it.

A thought that isn't true can trigger more emotions.


Remember: Taking care of yourself

***

How can I do this in a way na mas maingatan ako?
- Perhaps it's not about reminiscing.

Place-making approach
- go to the present din, open it now
- go to future din

Come up with questions na gagamitin mo kapag nandun ka na sa lugar

***

Practice presence
- Presence is different.

Then write about it. Iba naman.

7 dimensions

perceiving vs. seeing

Seeing it as it is now or how was it before?

Sensory
Day 1 ito siya
Day 2 ito siya

What will move you to photograph? (it will be the surprise)

Kapag nafeel mo o may naisip ka.

You can answer this when you're there na.

Your relationship with the camera you will meet at that time.

Awareness of the self.

Possible: When you see anything and you have an intention to photograph. If there is something arresting, allow it to unfold.
(contemplate it first)

Tsaka mo lang pipicturan.

Watch Walter Mitty.
