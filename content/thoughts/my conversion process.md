I wrote this after reading about [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka's]] conversion process in *[[literature/cosmic sage williams|Cosmic Sage]]*.

From being the son of JW parents, I embraced the faith myself through the example of others but most importantly, Niko Rabe. I once dreamt of following his footsteps. I communicated with him and even joined him in the ministry. When I reached Baguio, Ced Bartolome became a model but also Roy Agbayani and Crispin Rulloda.

I converted out of the JWs in a messy way. I didn't find a model to follow in [[thoughts/humanism|humanism]] or [[thoughts/atheism|atheism]]. Perhaps that's the reason why I didn't stay there for long. [[thoughts/dave ursillo|Dave Ursillo]] was the model I followed entering Eastern spirituality (yoga, taoism, buddhism, hinduism, new age, etc.). Shortly after this, I met [[thoughts/rem tanauan|Rem Tanauan]], but I never really saw him as a mentor for spirituality. To me, he was more like someone I practiced tolerance with and exchanged ideas.

In 2017, I converted to rational philosophy through [[thoughts/steve patterson|Steve Patterson]]. I would stay here for a long time that I didn't read much about [[thoughts/ethics|ethics]] (except for [[thoughts/amoralism|amoralism]]) and [[thoughts/religion|religion]]. I also distanced myself from the problematic word [[spirituality|spirituality]]. But I remained contemplative and practice zen meditation.

Through the long walk in 2022, I began entertaining the possibility of reintegrating religious aspects into my work. It became clear to me that "[[thoughts/how to live|how to live]]" was the central question of my life work. I entertained [[thoughts/deep philosophy|deep philosophy]], hoping to combine [[thoughts/contemplation|contemplation]] and [[thoughts/philosophy|philosophy]]. I also read about [[thoughts/lyrical philosophy|lyrical philosophy]] or [[thoughts/lyric philosophy|lyric philosophy]]. It was during these readings that I met [[thoughts/andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown]] and [[thoughts/unitarianism|unitarianism]] (and really liberal religion).

As of November 30, 2023, this is where I find myself: on the process of conversion into [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]]. I choose this path today because it is concerned primarily with the art of living and that it integrates well with all my other interests. Free religion because it is here where I find exemplars, that I could follow, guides to the life that I want. Interestingly, Andrew and Imaoka consider themselves inheritors of [[thoughts/transcendentalism|transcendentalism]], promulgated by [[thoughts/ralph waldo emerson|Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[thoughts/henry david thoreau|Henry David Thoreau]]. The latter is a long-time hero of mine.
