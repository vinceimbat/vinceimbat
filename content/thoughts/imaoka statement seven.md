7. I have faith in a specific religion. In other words, I am a member of the Tokyo Kiitsu Kyōkai. However, a specific religion (including the Tokyo Kiitsu Kyōkai) neither monopolizes religious truth nor is it the ultimate embodiment of it.

This statement is related to the previous one ([[thoughts/imaoka statement six|Imaoka's statement six]]). However, it is more specific as it assumes that one associates oneself to a religion. Free religion allows me to be part of any religion as long as I can see the religion not as the sole source of truth. In meditation, I should ask myself: "Do I honestly feel like associating and committing myself to a religion? Can I truly have faith on this religion?"

I am currently exploring [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]] in the context of [[unitarianism|unitarianism]]. After [[zen]], this is the only religion that I truly resonate with. But I haven't reach the point of complete faith as I still need to learn a lot about it. For now, to have [[faith]] is to maintain a sense of openness to Imaoka, free religion, and wherever this could bring me.
