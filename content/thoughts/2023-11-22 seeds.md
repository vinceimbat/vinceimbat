# Sauntering LB (SLB) - Walk 1

Theory: A walking exploration of the possibility of a subsistent spirituality

Method:
1. Seven days
2. Seven routes around LB
3. Seven dispatches at the end of the day (dispatches will be very rough drafts and sketches)
4. Media: Writing and photography
5. Open to whatever happens along the road. But will try to mix theory with what I know of the routes I'll be walking on and whatever falls on me on these walks.
6. Pop-up newsletter: deleted after the walk.

I knew of someone who needs her crystals, healing oils, i-ching, etc. To feel spiritual. Without these, she can't keep her calm, decide, live a moral life. The more she has the more she can live. She pays for expensive courses, expensive yoga classes, expensive retreats. 

I know this person: a conglomerate of individuals I met on the spiritual wilderness I launched myself on after leaving the JWs.

If there is anything which knows the difference between maximalism and minimalism, it is nature. Here on the street

What is the most essential projects at hand?

1. My exploration of free religion
2. My cultivation of a nurturing and freeing yet masterful writing practice
3. Life design
4. Building my own community
