# Summary

After reflecting on an excerpt from the essay "Presence, Memory, and Faith" by Steven E. Webb from *Wilderness and the Heart*, a book about [[henry bugbee|Henry Bugbee's]] philosophy, while walking one night at Ela Ave., I realized that I could find contentment in every moment regardless of the situation and despite things being not okay. I could do this through faith, a word I've avoided ever since [[a never-ending walk|leaving my childhood religion]], but now I'm exploring and reintegrating into my life through my interpretation. Indeed, [[thoughts/faith generates contentment|faith generates contentment]].

In response to my reading of [[thoughts/a religion of ones own by moore|A Religion of One's Own by Thomas Moore]], I started a [[thoughts/dream log|dream log]]. I noticed that starting a dream log seems to make me have more dreams and remember them.

My favorite thought note this month is: [[thoughts/art is never finished|Art is never finished]]. I wrote this while working on an essay I later sent to a literary journal. It talks about this modern bias to complete a work of art and why this could be going against the very nature of art.

The best things I read this month were:
- [[literature/lynda barry kios|Lynda Barry Will Make You Believe in Yourself by Dan Kios]]
- [[literature/nightingalingale by mod|The Nightingalingale Newsletter by Craig Mod]]

I published three newsletters this month:

- [[this morning|This Morning]]
- [[the possibility of love|The Possibility of Love]]
- [[sabel|Sabel]]

My application to the Cordillera Creative Writing Workshop (CCWW) was rejected and this got me thinking about how I'm approaching these applications and my writing life. I realized that, since the acceptance rate to these writing events is pretty low, the healthiest attitude when applying is to expect rejection. Then, use the application process to these events to force you to do your work. Everything should be about your personal projects. Articulate what your art stands for, focus on creating a portfolio around that stand, and never rely on others to tell you you're good or publishable. Stick to your gut feeling and use contests, workshops, and fellowships to serve your vision, not the other way around. I used this newfound perspective in approaching the submission process to the Gawad Bienvenido Lumbera (GBL).

September was jam-packed with writing projects. Aside from the GBL and writing revisions for a client, I also worked on an essay that forced me to articulate my entire writing system and practice for the first time. It was a fun essay that braids walking and my note-writing system and their implications for literature in general.

Around the middle of the month, Lea and I visited Bohol to celebrate our anniversary. The trip helped me get back to photography.
