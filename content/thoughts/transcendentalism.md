An offshoot of [[thoughts/unitarianism|unitarianism]] founded by [[thoughts/ralph waldo emerson|Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

Per [[thoughts/andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown]], [[thoughts/james martineau|James Martineau's]] Rationale of Religious Enquiry had a profound influence to the development of transcendentalism. According to Brown, most contemporary unitarian ministers "see themselves primarily as descendants of this Transcendentalist movement." And since [[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] has explicitly mentioned the influence Emerson had on him, it will also be an inspiration of his [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]].

This connection between transcendentalism and free religion makes sense why I have always been attracted to [[thoughts/henry david thoreau|Henry David Thoreau]] and why my desired life work is a combination of [[thoughts/philosophy|philosophy]], [[thoughts/contemplation|contemplation]], [[thoughts/writing|writing]] (and other art forms like [[thoughts/photography|photography]]), and [[facilitating]].

>Ripley's positive review of Martineau's book had a profound influence upon the subsequent development of the Transcendentalist movement and it began to help it definitively to move away from a biblically derived Christian Unitarianism.

>it seems important to note that most modern British and American Unitarian ministers -- including me -- see themselves primarily as descendants of this Transcendentalist movement
