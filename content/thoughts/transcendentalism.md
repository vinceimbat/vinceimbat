An offshoot of [[thoughts/unitarianism|unitarianism]] founded by [[thoughts/ralph waldo emerson|Ralph Waldo Emerson]].

Per [[thoughts/andrew j. brown|Andrew J. Brown]], [[thoughts/james martineau|James Martineau's]] Rationale of Religious Enquiry had a profound influence to the development of transcendentalism. According to Brown, most contemporary unitarian ministers "see themselves primarily as descendants of this Transcendentalist movement."

This will be the model of [[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka's]] [[thoughts/free religion|free religion]].
