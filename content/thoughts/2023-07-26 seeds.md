The body is place. But I am not seated in it. Given that the I I say I am is mental.

But what if who I am is the relationship between mental and physical?

I looked for you
You weren't there
I secretly hope you lived
Or someone else
Someone braver
Have taken you in
To watch your last breath

I walked away from where I first saw you
Still hearing
Your piercing cry
I raised my head up the sky
Two nimbus clouds raced
On the back of the wind
The dark chasing them

I forgive myself
I forgive myself
