# Past Year Questions

## List your 3 top wins for the year.

1. Admitting that I need help in navigating grieving my past spiritual life and embracing a free, creative spirituality that does not run away from anything.
2. Regaining some consistency of income stream via the Bookbright OVIC overview updates after being saved by gigs.
3. Accelerating my growth in writing, photography, walking, and spirituality by meeting archetypes and nurturing my relationships with them (including Louise, Froi, and Andrew).

## What are the biggest lessons youâ€™ve learned in the past year?

1. Never feel guilty protecting your boundaries.
2. The right archetypes will accelerate your growth.
3. Contentment is a choice. You can choose to be contented no matter what the situation if you have faith.
4. The best place to look for a job is one's existing network.
5. Use writing workshops and contests as tools to force you to work on or get feedback on your personal projects.
6. It is okay to let go of the desire to work on some creative projects (writing in Pangasinan, poetry, etc.). Try to focus on what works and what you truly enjoy: writing in English, writing vignettes, improving photography, and getting better at walking.
7. I am a river. I could change.
8. No matter how solitary my work is, I can and should always include the other in it. Considering public life is necessary and inescapable.
9. Upgrade only when necessary. Don't try to fix what isn't broken.
10. Introduce changes slowly.
11. Art is never finished.
12. What I desire for myself is a free, subsistent spirituality.
13. I would like to treat writing as my new ministry: to use words to help me live a rich life and to help others do the same.

## What were the risks you took?

1. Applying for that writing project with Krys (writing an email application then doing the interview).
2. Dedicating some time writing that essay for ANWW20 even if I still didn't have a consistent source of income.
3. Presenting an intimate and sensitive personal story to an audience of strangers.
4. Asking Lea to subsidize a significant amount of my couple fund contribution.
5. Dedicating a lot of time writing entries for workshops and contests while still without a consistent source of income.
6. Emailing Cinque and asking for a possible part-time role in Bookbright.
7. Emailing Andrew to ask for help.
8. Joining Miki Nakura's seiza meditation classes and attending several times.
9. Hoping into a call with Andrew.

## What about your work, are you most committed to changing and improving?

I'm committed to improving my writing.
- This involves really focusing and getting better on the kind of writing I want to do (right now, that seems to be vignettes in English). This focus means letting go of writing in Filipino, Pangasinan, and poetry, at least, for now.
- I'm committed to reading as much as I need to read to identify how my voice is different and what gap I could fill.
- I'm committed to practice writing every day.
- I'm committed to strengthening the foundation of my personal writing practice as both a spiritual and expressive practice.
- I'm committed to exploring the possibilities of using writing as a form of service or ministry.
- I'm committed to reaching out and nurturing relationships with writing archetypes that could help me get better with the writing I want to do.
- I'm committed to creating the book about LB.
- I'm committed to exploring writing about walking in Baguio City.

I'm committed to improving my photography.
- This involves working closely with a mentor, like Louise Far.
- Creating a plan to practice deliberately, perhaps using Ultra-learning.
- Doing more shoots this year.

I'm committed to improving my walking.
- I would schedule more walks this year (aspire at least one walking event every month).
- I would also try facilitating Walking and Talking events.

I'm committed to improving my free religion practice.
- I'm committed to deepening my seiza practice.
- I'm committed to listening more to myself.
- I'm committed to opening more to others.
- I'm committed to exploring existing in a kyokai.

## What is one as yet undeveloped talent you are willing to explore?

Connecting and interviewing people in my walks.

## What brings you the most joy and how are you going to do or have more of that?

Working on projects where I have the most creative freedom.

I'll do more of this by returning to my core first and always asking myself what do I want to get out of my art practice and life. Then, from there, design a portfolio life that fulfills those wants and needs.

To have this, I also need to strengthen my income flow. Now that I have some measure of predictability, I need to build resilience.

## What one word or phrase would you like to have as your theme?

Authenticity and Focus

## Set Your Intention:

This 2024, my main intention is to do everything necessary to find and listen to my most authentic voice and to use it in writing my story and truth.

A secondary intention would be to cut unnecessary goals and to focus on the most authentic, exciting, and life-changing ones.
