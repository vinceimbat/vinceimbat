A father and a small son came out of Banawe. The son was crying softly, the father speaking determinately, "Wag kang matakot dun." He repeats this several times and the child seems to have responded after a few of these. He bought him to a store at Sapphire St. and asked the child what he wants. The child chooses as his father talks to the lady store keeper. "Kelan ka dumating?" the lady asks. "Kanina lang," the father answered.
