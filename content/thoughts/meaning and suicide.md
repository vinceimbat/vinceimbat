If things should exist they have to be finite. The universe exists therefore it is finite.

If the universe is finite there will come a point where our search for a larger purpose ends.

There is no inherent meaning.

[[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless|Life is inherently meaningless]]. Nevertheless, [[thoughts/meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness|meaningful living is possible despite meaninglessness]] if we do our best to put meaning into our lives.

Taken at face value, the grave is the goal and killing myself is the most logical thing to do.

To avoid this, I must create meaning.

To choose to live even if suicide is an alternative is courageous. To keep on standing is to believe on something we didn't even choose for ourselves ([[We did not choose to exist]]), something that is hard and can be harder, but sill valuable. Life is just a big acceptance project. We accept that we are alive and accept everything that life throws at us.

Creating our own meaning and purpose is the next step after acceptance.
