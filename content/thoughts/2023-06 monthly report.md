# Summary

I returned to photography this month when I spent two days learning how to use the Canon EOS M50 Mark II through YouTube videos and more importantly the book [[literature/read this if you want to take great photos by carroll|Read This If You Want to Take Great Photos by Henry Carroll]] for Bukas na Hapag. In that event, I experienced eating Tempeh Itum, Binatog Elote, Dinnanaw at Gininub, and Kulawong Talong while learning about the intricacies of the Filipino food system.

The biggest highlight of the month was, of course, my preparation and attendance to the [[anww20|ANWW20]]. Through this, I experienced preparing a presentation and delivering it to a group. I also experienced receiving close, practical feedback on my work. I also made new friends from my co-fellows and panelists. I particularly enjoyed my chats with [[elio garcia|Elio Garcia]], [[vincenz serrano|Vincenz Serrano]], [[thoughts/jhoanna lynn cruz|Jhoanna Lynn Cruz]], [[thoughts/junley lazaga|Junley Lazaga]], and [[thoughts/eli guieb|Eli Guieb]]. At the graduation ceremony, I also got the chance to read [[translations/isang tahanang tatawagin nating bukas|Isang Tahanang Tatawagin Nating Bukas]].

This month, like most months, was an opportunity to enrich relationships. Before leaving for Ateneo, Lea and I bonded with Bevs and Embi, who shared that he also came from a pastor's family. Before checking in at Ateneo, I met with [[louise far|Louise Far]] with whom I exchanged life stories and insights. She also gave me a copy of her book [[literature/inahan sa sugilanon by louise far|Inahan sa Sugilanon]]. After checking in at Ateneo and having dinner with my co-fellows, I walked with Maui, Yano, and Ron around UP Oval then went to the University Hotel.

After ANWW20, I went back to Pangasinan to attend Bernice's wedding. I travelled with Lea and I introduced her to my extended family. After Lea left, I went back to Cablong and met Kitkat for the first time. Later, I met Ate Li and family for the first time in 10 years (?) then we had dinner at Naro Cafe.

While doing all of these, I continued working on Ili's website and Candent's marketing strategy, while reading *On Writing Well*, *The Collapse of What Separates Us*, and *Wanderlust* in between.

Lastly, I did several first-time walks this month: the walk from IRH to Katipunan, the walk along Maramba Blvd., and the walk at Matic-Matic–Maronong Road. I also experimented with using geolocation in my walking notes.
