Individuals with personal and autonomous religions (i.e. [[jiyu shukyo|jiyu shukyo]]) can still come together and gather into a "church" (or [[thoughts/kiitsu kyokai|kiitsu kyokai]]). This variety is exactly what is necessary for a cooperative community to emerge. We shouldn't aspire for a community that is not plural, agrees to a single way of thinking, and penalizes divergent thinking. It is our differences with the people around us that teaches us how to practice tolerance, patience, kindness, and love.
