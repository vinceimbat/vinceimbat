3. I have faith in a cooperative society. Both oneself and a neighbour, while each possessing a unique personality, are not things that exist in isolation. Because of this uniqueness, a true interdependence, true solidarity, and true human love are established, and therein a cooperative society is realized.

I need only to look within me and my memory to be convinced that to love my neighbour as I do myself is true and this path shall forge the world I want to live in. I shall focus on thinking about the practice of love and how I can embody it daily toward myself, my neighbour, and the world.

This third statement by [[thoughts/shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]] can work even if one believes that constituents of the universe are first independent entities. It will even work if one is a metaphysical dualist ([[thoughts/metaphysical dualism is not ethical separation|metaphysical dualism is not ethical separation]]). No matter what the metaphysical status of the self, the only commitment the statement asks is faith on an obvious fact of reality: we are dependent on others and the world to exist and thrive in this life.

The statement also asks that we recognize the uniqueness of each person. If we see the [[self]] as bundled and ever-changing like a river, then it is easy to see how a person can be unique.

I have written many times that our adherence to certain things and institutions reflect [[faith]]. For example, our adherence to a government reflects our faith in representative leadership. None of these assures that we we will live a good life. If nothing is assured and everything requires faith, then I should choose whom I will give my faith to liberally.

Having faith on the ever-changing river that is me and my neighbour means I will never put up walls to inhibit the flow. Instead, in my daily dealings and my work, I will be partial in my belief that I and my neighbour can always change and will always change and that I should help myself and my neighbour embrace our true uniqueness and, therefore, [[freedom]].

I am aware that this free, ever-changing river that makes each of us unique could be the root of division like war. But I chose to be open, listen, and trust on the ability of this uniqueness to create a vibrant, beautiful world.

Lastly, many will dismiss a belief in the possibility of a cooperative society, where uniqueness leads to interdependence. This is almost an anarchic utopia that is both pluralistic and cooperative. The world doesn't seem to be going this way. But I believe in this utopia. I will die working to bring forth one.

How can I spend more time bringing such a world forth in my own way?

Questions:
- How can I show my faith on the uniqueness of each individual?
- How can I show faith that this uniqueness in each individual holds the potential for interdependence, solidarity, and love?
- How can I show faith that a cooperative society is possible?
