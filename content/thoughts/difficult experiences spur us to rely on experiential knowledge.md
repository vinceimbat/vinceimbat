If my depression of 2011 didn't happen, I would've continued to focus on the big thoughts and questions of life. But since it happened, I have become more concerned about the practicality of knowledge ([[Pragmatism]]) and how all of them relate to a single practical question: [[thoughts/how to live]]

Experience, specially difficult experiences, makes us trust our experiences more, makes us more interested in them and makes us learn from them more.
