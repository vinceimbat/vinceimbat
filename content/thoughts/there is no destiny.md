The reason why there is no destiny is because, we seem to have [[Free will]]â€”that is, the ability to determine our own actions.

For me, the thought that there is no universal, absolute, natural purpose arising from the universe with which I "ought" to comply with is liberating.

That means [[We create our individual purpose]]. I don't have to follow a set of rules written on unearthed decaying papyrus.

I make my own rules.
