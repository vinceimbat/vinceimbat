What if I just stop talking about metaphysics (just being careful that I don't make mistakes in it) then focus on just celebrating my inner life and outdoor adventures.

I believe that championing truth is an important work, which in some way I am contributing to. But it is not my job to champion and fight for it. There are more capable people for that.

My job is to enjoy this one life - this one subjective experience and perhaps through it, others could celebrate theirs.
