Dogs are like portals to the past.
Their ages overlap, but If you've kept at least one dog consistently in your life, there would be a dog that would always be attached to important transitions in your life.
Divide your age by ten. That's the number of important dogs in your life.

Kara was the dog that helped us moved on from the loss of the chihuahuas. She left around the time we graduated from high school. She died of old age. The oldest dog. Healthiest. Pomeranian. Picky eater.

Bubbles was the dog when we were all in college. She was with our parents.

Doji came when I was getting just recovering from depression. He left when I moved to LB.

Kako is currently the main dog. But she'll be leaving in five or more years.

After her, Kitkat will be the dog.
