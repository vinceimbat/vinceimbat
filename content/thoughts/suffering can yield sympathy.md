Granted, the person suffering is always in danger of self-centeredness. It is easy to focus so much on one's suffering and blackout everything else. But in what can only be a miracle, the person suffering could sometimes use that suffering as a portal to witness the suffering of others more clearly and respond to them in ways that those who have never suffered could not.

May we never let suffering kill our humanity.
