It's important to note that ambivalence can occur in both newer and long-term relationships, and it's a normal part of any relationship's journey. However, each partner is responsible for understanding their own emotions and communicating with their partner about their doubts, insecurities, fears, and concerns if they want to overcome them and move the relationship forward.

While there is always compromise in any healthy relationship, it shouldn't feel like you're sacrificing your own personal growth or goals. You should be excited about how your partner supports your growth as an individual.

If you're unable to effectively communicate and share emotional intimacy with your partner, you and your partner may not be the best match.

if you want more independence but stay put out of fear, this could lead to even bigger problems.

Believe it or not, not talking can be just as damaging, if not more so, than arguing. If you find yourself avoiding difficult conversations or discussions, this could mean that both parties are beginning to emotionally leave the relationship.

When it comes to handling an ambivalent relationship, the most important thing to remember is that you are in control.

it's important to maintain kindness and respect towards your partner. Rejecting animosity or spiteful behavior can help create an environment to work through the ambivalence productively.

It's important, to be honest with yourself and your partner about the current state of the relationship. Acknowledging that the relationship is in a fragile state can help both partners understand their own feelings and work towards creating a healthier future together.
