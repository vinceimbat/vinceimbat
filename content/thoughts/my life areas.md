I have six [[thoughts/life area|life areas]]:
1. [[thoughts/overseeing|Overseeing]]
2. [[thoughts/understanding|Understanding]]
3. [[thoughts/restoring|Restoring]]
4. [[thoughts/connecting|Connecting]]
5. [[thoughts/sustaining|Sustaining]]
6. [[thoughts/creating|Creating]]

Rather than clear silos that box projects, these life areas behave like tags. One project could be tagged with multiple life areas. This implies that a project could improve multiple life area standards simultaneously. To not be overwhelmed in maintaining my life's standards, I follow this advice: [[thoughts/live as if you are walking|live as if you are walking]].
