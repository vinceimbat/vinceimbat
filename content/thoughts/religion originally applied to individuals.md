The concept of religion was derived from the Latin term *religio*, which roughly corresponds to the words "scrupulousness," "conscientiousness," "devotedness," or "felt obligation." The word was associated to practices that were not necessarily related to gods. As a noun it was used to refer to "worship." As an adjective, it referred to "people who were devout."

>The concept religion did not originally refer to a social genus or cultural type. It was adapted from the Latin term religio, a term roughly equivalent to “scrupulousness”. Religio also approximates “conscientiousness”, “devotedness”, or “felt obligation”, since religio was an effect of taboos, promises, curses, or transgressions, even when these were unrelated to the gods.
