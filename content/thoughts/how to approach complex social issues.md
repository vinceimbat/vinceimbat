I wrote this note after writing about the 2023 war between Hamas and Israel.

Here are steps I can take to approach difficult social issues:
1. More than ever, strengthen your personal spiritual practices. Be serious with [[seiza]]. Aspire to do the right postures, apply it in daily life, slowly lengthen your practice, and continue practicing with a group. In addition to seiza, be more intentional in the daily practices that help you listen to yourself, especially when it's hard. These practices include [[journaling]], note-writing, [[walking]], and [[thoughts/photography]].
2. Be more intentional in curating who you connect with on social media. Only pay attention to those who can reinforce you on your path. Create a community where you don't feel pressured to immediately take a stand.
3. Learn from spiritual exemplars who haven't turn a blind eye from what is happening but approaches these matters with an open mind, open heart, and moderation.
4. Be unapologetically you. Be genuine. Talk about matters important to you, especially those that people are not talking about, issues dear to your heart.
