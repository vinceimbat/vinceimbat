- Managing relationships with writers and giving them helpful feedback
- Creating and editing a table in Word
- Creating an illustrations list, with suitably shortened entries
- Consistency
- Handling figures, images, and tables in a text.
- Cross-referencing text, in-text citations, bibliographical references, tables, figures, and footnotes.
- Understand the basic principles of an index and be able to edit one.
- Know on-screen editing
- Know website editing
	- Making content web friendly (make scanning easier, create sentences and paragraphs that are shorter than the equivalent printed text and insert concise, factual subheadings every two or three paragraphs.)
	- Write concise descriptive headings and summaries of web pages, which can be used on higher-level pages to link them to those web pages or as file descriptions (metadata) that can be found by a search engine.
	- Rewrite sentences so that the target (internal or external) of a linked word or phrase is clear, avoiding the use of ‘Click here’ or ‘More’ wherever possible. Check that all links work and whether the client wishes to include a disclaimer for the content of external sites.
	- Advise on the splitting of content across additional linked pages (modules) to facilitate direct access to those additional pages from elsewhere on the site and from search engines.
	- Access and comment on the functionality of multimedia files integrated with web pages – for example, audio, video, animations – and any associated text. Liaise with the author, designer or developer, depending on the editor’s content knowledge, to amend these elements if necessary.
	- Write or edit text that describes images, other multimedia elements and links, for use when images are turned off or when a screen reader is being used by a visually impaired user.
	- Create a site map to describe all or part of a website or add to an existing one.


Proofreading
- Pagination
	- Ensure that the page sequence within the document is complete.
- Paragraphs
	- If paragraphs are numbered, ensure that the numbering sequence is correct.
- Using the editor's style guide when proofreading.
	- Follow the editorial style guide (the list of spellings, etc adopted by the copyeditor and passed on to the proofreader) if provided. If this is not available, compile a style guide while reading the proofs. Do not seek to amend or ‘improve’ a copyeditor’s work unless specifically asked to do so by the client. Errors and omissions should, of course, be corrected or queried.
- Chapter and/or section titling.
	- Ensure that chapter titles and subheadings in the contents page(s) and the body of the text correspond, and insert page numbers or ensure that, if present, they correspond.
- Running heads
	- Ensure that running heads are correct and correspond to the convention required.
- Headings
	- Check that type size, style and fonts all appear consistent.
- Fonts, alignment and line length
	- Identify erroneous font changes, misalignments and inappropriate line lengths and suggest corrected formats. Check alignment of columns in tables.
- Page design
	- Check bad word breaks and column breaks, and eliminate widows and orphans if required by the client. In books with a complex design layout (many illustrations, tables, etc), ensure that these are placed logically and that the text can be read easily.
- Collation
	- Proofreaders may be required to collate proof-correction marks made by several individuals – for example, author, adviser, other proofreader. Where comments are in conflict, the proofreader/proof collator should be able to make justifiable judgements and amend appropriately, to maintain the required quality of the final product, the schedule, the budget and good author relations.
