# Summary

This was perhaps one of those full months. I started it by attending the Writing to Free Your Heart workshop by Rofel Brion at Casa San Pablo. The workshop gave me an opportunity to build my relationships with Sir Rofel and Ms. An while enjoying Casa San Pablo. This was a month of workshops. Maui's Ilihan Workshops exposed me to new friends like Louise Far who gave me a much-needed affirmation to start the photo book about walking LB this year no matter what. Speaking of walking and writing, my essay on traversing liminality through walking got me a spot at the upcoming ANWW20. This news encouraged me to return to the craft of writing and learn in preparation for it.

Interestingly, I also designed, simulated, and held two Nasa Labas ang Ili guided walks this month as part of the Ilihan workshops. These walks connected me with beautiful new friends and provided further motivation to my desire to write a book about LB.

All of these events and interactions moved me to return to my core—my sky level. I improved my sky level by spending some time at the middle of this month clarifying my purpose, vision, mission, and life goals.

While enjoying all of these creative activities, I was able to learn how to create processes for offering web design and development services for clients. My proposal for Ili Likhaan Ceramics was accepted. I also began improving my personal website by putting newsletters into individual folders and redirecting links.

I also tried a few new cafes and restaurants for the first time this month: Viewpoint Cafe, Burgarage, Malaya Cafe, Gong Cha, and House of Aina.

I finished the book May Nagsabi Sa Akin by Rofel Brion and The Deleted World by Tomas Tranströmer. In series, I really enjoyed Beef. In movies, I was moved by The Fundamentals of Caring.
