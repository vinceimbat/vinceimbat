Leaves outside my window are the most important thing today. Nothing else matters at this moment. Nothing else.

Let go. Do not fight life. Life is but a music out of tune. Dislocated. Ever-escaping your inner harmony.

It plays by itself, against your will.

And there's nothing you can do about it.

What comes out of all these is empathy, tolerance, and perhaps eve compassion—a paradoxical love.

An undeserved love.

A faithful love.

A love that expands us.

A love that forgives and, therefore, makes everything possible.

Rain dropping from above the trees.

My house's roof sheds these leaves from water.

They remain calm, untouched.

Moving briefly when their stalks and stems are bothered by water.

They too—water, leaves, everything—are part of what makes this world possible, what makes love possible.

Nothing should fit and yet we allow the to fit.
