I write about my thoughts and experiences. Specifically, I write about my life stories, studies, and walks. Living, studying, and walking produce the first level of [[Intermediate packets]], which are then converted into higher-level packets. All of these packets serve one thing: the creation of books.

Here are creative artifacts I want to produce
1. Notes in [[thoughts/forest garden of the mind]]: [[thoughts/seeds]], [[thoughts/seedlings]], and [[thoughts/evergreens]]
2. Photos
3. Poems
4. Newsletter updates about trying to pursue my calling as a contemplative and philosophically-inclined creative, while supporting myself through independent meaningful work.
5. Essays
6. Books (I want to create beautiful books that combine photographs, narratives, and poems, basically the artifacts I produce)

Here are the artifacts in different stages of my creative process.

# Level 1

L1 IPs are the inputs captured through several inboxes (camera, journal, etc.). These inputs need to be processed. These IPs include:

- Unedited photos
- Journal entries
- Fleeting notes
- Unedited videos
- Unedited audios

# Level 2

When L1 IPs are processed and storied, they become L2 IPs. These IPs are resources that are easily accessible and ready to be deployed for any projects. These IPs include:

- Edited photos
- Narratives
- Personal narratives
- Zettels
- Quotes
- Poems
- Translations
- Other drafts
- Outlines
- Edited videos
- Edited audios

# Level 3

When L2 IPs are deployed to be used into projects, their synthesis create publishable (yet still intermediate) artifacts. These IPs include:

- Essays
- Personal essays
- Stories
- Poems
- Photo essays
- Newsletters

# Level 4

The integration of L2 and L3 IPs create the ultimate publishable artifact in my life work:

- Books

I want to write and create beautiful non-fiction books that combine narrative, personal narratives, philosophy, culture, history, photos, quotes, prose, and translations.

My idea is to write several books that tackle the most important topics I care about that pieced together could illuminate the worldview I am building.
