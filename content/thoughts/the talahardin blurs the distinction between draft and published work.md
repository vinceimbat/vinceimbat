Because it publishes drafts as they are in the process of being developed, the [[talahardin|talahardin]] blurs the modern distinction between [[draft]] and published work. This is possible through cheap and democratized technology (see [[the draft flourishes through cheap and democratized technology|the draft flourishes through cheap and democratized technology]]).

>More than those before them, 20th century modernists sought to break down the distinction between the published literary work and the working draft. Modern, postmodern, and early 21st century writers have sought and still seek to expose the processes of writing, miswriting, and rewriting through the machinations of aesthetic form. Such efforts, of course, hinge on an a priori understanding of the “draft” as a category of significance and reverberate from the emergence and development of print culture, the concept of autonomous authorship, and the belief in and institutional structures to support collection and preservation.
