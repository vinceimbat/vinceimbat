Walking under a thunderstorm

What is it like to walk under a thunderstorm
It is like nothing can stop u
But also like being an unfortunate prey
Of A ? stalker with a really bad temper but also excellent photographic skills
It is like someone somewhere has decided to take ur photo repeatedly and u cant stop him
And then he gets mad and makes it known whe u dont get it ryt
And you hide, cover your ears, flee naturally because you are afraid.
But this makes him even angrier.
And occassionally, when you really piss him off
He lets out this really loud angry call that would deafen ur ears and swear to god you wouldnt ever ever get out of a thunderstorm again
But before u can do that
You have to find ur way first under the sea of blood
The pool and whatever that angry stalker left on his way

Fruits fall here like the kittens I saw die.
