Connecting involves engaging with a [[thoughts/scenius|scenius]], which is composed of a [[thoughts/mentor|mentor]] and peers from a [[thoughts/community of practice|community of practice]] ([[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers|my ideal mentors and peers]]).

I need to invest time and energy to establish long-lasting relationships in real life or online.

There are two main goals when connecting:

1. To find conversation partners who would help me sharpen my theories and my methods
2. To build an audience who would eventually support my work financially as patrons

To make this possible, I need to seek the following relationships:

1. Possible mentors
2. Possible peers
3. Possible fans

Fans will be my patrons, they would support me in adopting a [[thoughts/patronage model|patronage model]], which is my choice of sustainability model ([[thoughts/a patronage model is best for an independent creative|a patronage model is best for an independent creative]]). Mentors and peers could be patrons too, but their main role is to sharpen my theories and methods.

To connect effectively, I follow a [[thoughts/strategy for connecting|strategy for connecting]] (see also [[thoughts/slow connecting for introverts|slow connecting for introverts]]).
