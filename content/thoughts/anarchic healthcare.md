No matter how skilled and well-intentioned the healers, they lack the most important information in any healing journey: the subjective experience of the patient. Healers may try to deduce this by asking questions but their deduction will always be incomplete. Even healers who may have had a similar health condition, who went through the same illness will still lack knowledge of the exact subjective experience of the patient.

All healing journeys will dramatically improve if the self is placed at the center. The more the patient involves themself into the process of healing, the better.
