[[2023-09-08]]:

- I was with [[jesa suganob|Jesa Suganob]]. We wanted to hang out with an adult male friend but we were afraid to ask. So Jesa just tried to buy him food. There's a line of white stalls with vendors.
- I replaced Lea with Kris Ann. We were walking together toward somewhere. My arm was around her shoulder.

- Tita Vilma was scolding Tita Vicky. Migs was sleepy. But they were trying to feed him bread with cheese. Papa said, "Narasan itan."
- I was in front of a lawyer asking him to sign my ID. Turns out, he was someone I wrote a letter to about an old man I was asking for help with. Someone changed the date of my ID. It was the date of the start of my schooling. The lawyer noticed this and corrected it. He said, "Meron ka palang iniwan sa'king letter" (concerning the old man). I was in line when we were called to proceed to him. He was in a desk behind something. The office was really wide like an airport. There were bright lights everywhere.
- The river was alive. I fell down on it and it just ran away.

- Papa was driving us on an SUV. He suddenly left the car. I made the car run but felt afraid so I pedaled the break but didn't know how to totally make the car stop. We came to a place with ponds like Tita Villa's place in Binmaley. I told Ate Mau to drive. She said she don't know too. So I asked them to get off the car while it is still moving a bit. When they tried to get off, papa arrived with a limp on his one foot. It was his left foot, I think. I asked him, "Nila yo?"" He answered by telling me about his limp.

Undated
- I had several dreams with Lau in it. The first dream, Lau, Lea, and another ex of mind (Precious?) were in an island with me. I felt weird that it happened but it seems that it was entirely my fault and that I was maintaining all those three relationships at the same time and my secret was revealed because of this mistake.
- The second dream, Lau and I attended a wedding but we didn't know that we were both there. She seemed ok with me and we had a conversation and caught up. She was smiling and may even be flirting with mo. Or was I doing the flirting?

- Cari was sick with some small spots. I thought she was dying. I had Bernice call Papa. Bernice said she had this before.

- Our family was sitting in the Sta. Maria kingdom hall, in our usual seats in front. There were three sisters. When we were about to sing, I carried the youngest. I said I have so much love to give but no one wants it. We sang "Inakay ka ng Diyos sa kaliwanagan..."
- I also dreamt that the OVIC Overview updates were only USD 50.

- I am at the Sta. Maria house alone with some dogs. The only dog I recognize is Pua. A really large storm arrives. I open the window and saw this massive tornado. But it wasn't raining. I saw someone still walking on the fields outside. I closed the window. Suddenly, the house shook. Then some rain poured but it wasn't that strong. I heard this animal flying around the wind. I went downstairs. I saw Pua there. She came from the outside. I took her. I felt that she had a fever. We went inside the bedroom under the mosquito net. I saw her lie down like Kako.

[[2023-11-11]]: Claire exhumes Rem. But Rem has bones left. Not dust.

[[2023-11-16]]: Days of storm. Then some signs of fair weather. But then out of nowhere, tornadoes: three of them. I saw from a window. I heard someone shout, "Aman Jehovah!"

[[2024-01-27]]: I was given a role to fix the menu for a wedding of a JW friend as well as perhaps host the wedding.
