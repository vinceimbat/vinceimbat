- I was with [[thoughts/jesa suganob|Jesa Suganob]]. We wanted to hang out with an adult male friend but we were afraid to ask. So Jesa just tried to buy him food. There's a line of white stalls with vendors.
- I replaced Lea with Kris Ann. We were walking together toward somewhere. My arm was around her shoulder.

- Tita Vilma was scolding Tita Vicky. Migs was sleepy. But they were trying to feed him bread with cheese. Papa said, "Narasan itan."
- I was in front of a lawyer asking him to sign my ID. Turns out, he was someone I wrote a letter to about an old man I was asking for help with. Someone changed the date of my ID. It was the date of the start of my schooling. The lawyer noticed this and corrected it. He said, "Meron ka palang iniwan sa'king letter" (concerning the old man). I was in line when we were called to proceed to him. He was in a desk behind something. The office was really wide like an airport. There were bright lights everywhere.
- The river was alive. I fell down on it and it just ran away.

- Papa was driving us on an SUV. He suddenly left the car. I made the car run but felt afraid so I pedaled the break but didn't know how to totally make the car stop. We came to a place with ponds like Tita Villa's place in Binmaley. I told Ate Mau to drive. She said she don't know too. So I asked them to get off the car while it is still moving a bit. When they tried to get off, papa arrived with a limp on his one foot. It was his left foot, I think. I asked him, "Nila yo?"" He answered by telling me about his limp.

Undated
- I had several dreams with Lau in it. The first dream, Lau, Lea, and another ex of mind (Precious?) were in an island with me. I felt weird that it happened but it seems that it was entirely my fault and that I was maintaining all those three relationships at the same time and my secret was revealed because of this mistake.
- The second dream, Lau and I attended a wedding but we didn't know that we were both there. She seemed ok with me and we had a conversation and caught up. She was smiling and may even be flirting with mo. Or was I doing the flirting?
