My audience and community is just a community made up of individuals who match [[My ideal audience persona]]. Each part of my community will be part of a larger community or several communities and fields. They become part of my community by the sole reason that they have shown some amount of interest into the work that I do. I am the node that ties them together. They don't have to be a subscriber to my newsletter. As long as they have heard and resonated with my work intimately, they are part of my community.

This implies that I do not have to plug myself into an existing field ([[thoughts/my criteria for choosing a field]]). I could create my own small field of knowledge that binds the different fields or communities of practice existing into a single thread that is my work.

My audience and community are made up of:

1. Mentors
2. Peers
3. Fans

For information about mentors and peers, see [[thoughts/my ideal mentors and peers]]. For information on fans, see [[My ideal audience persona]].

This community grows and continues to exist by:

- Me continuing to do the work, which is the thread that binds these people together.
- Me facilitating opportunities for my audience to interact with each other.
- Me reaching out to potential new members of my audience, i.e., possible mentors, peers, and fans.
- Me nurturing existing relationships with members of my audience.
