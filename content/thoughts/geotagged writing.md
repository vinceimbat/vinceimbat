Tool:
- when I am walking, I jot down a thought. I want that thought to have all kinds of identity: exact place on the map and time it came.
- Enacting the songlines in the time of the internet.
- What I want is to generate a map based on these seeds.
- This is using walking to generate insights -> meaning of place -> recreating landscape (the map created from this is your universe)

If I am interested in memory and walking then this naturally traverses history
