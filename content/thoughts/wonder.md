The concepts of religion and spirituality are too hard for me to understand.

What I do understand is a concept that I think is the core of both: wonder.

I wonder the fact that I am alive and so I express gratefulness.

I wonder about this bird and so I write a poem about it.

Others won't always feel this although everyone can access this feeling.

Wonder is what inspired our ancestors to create songs about rivers, mountains, landscapes.
