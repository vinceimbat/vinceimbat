To be completely honest, I would really love to exploit this depression and write in an uberly melodramatic way filled with all the terrors of the mind and the body. That would probably make my writing better and I might just pull it off. But I've been around this shit for so long I know it is a gamble. I could intentionally pull myself down there and might never return again. I can't take that risk now. After everything I went through for this sanity.
