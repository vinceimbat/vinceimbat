Main project is setting the stage for a body of work. I need to finish my research on walking and jiyu shukyo, at least in order to create a poetics.

Jiyu shukyo is the poetics. Walking, photography, and writing are the tools.

What projects are priorities?
Take into consideration workshop applications and contests.
