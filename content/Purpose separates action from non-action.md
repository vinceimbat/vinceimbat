An end state does not have to satisfy a purpose for an action to occur. The most important part of an action is the articulation of purpose. Without articulating one's purpose before an action ([[Purpose is articulated before an action or a project is performed]]), the behaviour is not purposeful. As long as you have a conscious intention, then you acted, whether you succeeded or not. If you fail, you review what happened and learn from it.

This process is automatic. It is simply a description of what the brain does.

An example of an action is “throwing a dart.”

- Your [[thoughts/purpose]] is to hit the bull’s eye.# Intention separates action from non-action
- Your [[Means]] to satisfy that intention is to throw the dart.
- The [[End state]] is whatever happens after you throw the dart.
- The [[Review]] is when you realize you didn’t hit the bull’s eye.
