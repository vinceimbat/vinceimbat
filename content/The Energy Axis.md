This is an exercise in [[literature/belong agrawal]]. Here are the steps:
1. Make a list of people you are currently spending time with in a regular basis.
2. Categorize these people (e.g., family, friends, workmates, etc.). For each category, designate a color.
3. On a piece of paper, draw X and Y axes at the middle. The X axis presents how a particular relationship makes you feel: negative or positive. The Y axis presents the level of vitality or enthusiasm a relationship has: low or high.
4. Plot each person in your list on the graph based on how they make you feel (negative or positive) and the energy level they exude (low or high). Use the designated color for that person's category.
5. Reflect and make conclusions about the general tendency of your relationships and how they might be affecting your own energy.
