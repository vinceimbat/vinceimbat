Identify what matters most in your life (not just in creating). These are:
- things you pour your time, energy, and money into;
- things you would fight for;
- things you would put your time and energy every day, week, and month; and
- things you wouldn't give up.

Only pursue projects that are a core part of what matters most in your life (not just in addition to them). Because you believe in what matters most in your life, you will also believe more in your projects regardless of external validation from the marketplace and public milestones.

Along with these values are the practices that express them. Both inform the narratives you tell and that connects you with your reader.

The topics you could talk about nonstop and the people you enjoy being around also tell your narratives.
