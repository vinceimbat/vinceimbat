The wonder that inspires us to revere something or the universe in general, does not have to lead to worshiping, as if we let that govern our lives. We can feel reverence while maintaining a sense of self-governance and freedom.

But to conclude that the unmovable mover is a jump a big jump. Just because something is that doesnt mean it is God. But it does means it is the first cause, which probably means it is God?
