J,

I hate to say this but if there's another way to break the monotony of my daily existence, I'll do that instead of this. If there's another way to see magenta turn to orange and back, I would do that instead of this. If I could stay where I am if I wake up I'm old and say I lived a good life, I would do that instead.

And yet due to a lack of options, I walk.

I mean, just now, I passed by Meister's and I could've been born just to be sitting on one of those chairs at this very moment. And yet here I am. Walking! Can you imagine that? I mean, it was as if everything that has ever happened to me, every person I've ever met, conspired to make sure on this August afternoon, magenta contra orange, I walk.
