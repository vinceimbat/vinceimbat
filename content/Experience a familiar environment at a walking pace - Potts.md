“… In seeking to experience a familiar environment at a walking pace, you aren’t just slowing down and savoring that place in a new way; you’re opening yourself up to ways of knowing and feeling that you can’t encounter while cooped up at home. Instead of filling your mind with new information, a walk clears it out and opens it up to innovative ways of thinking; instead of focusing your attention on concrete plans, a walk allows you to more vividly dream of wide-open possibilities.”

~ Rolf Potts
