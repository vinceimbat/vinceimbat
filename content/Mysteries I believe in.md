When describing the universe, there will always be mystery—things that we can’t seem to understand *right now*. However, not all mysteries are created equal. So, it’s not a matter of deciding whether mysteries exist or not. It’s all a matter of what kind of mystery should we believe exists.

Here are some mysteries I believe in:

- The universe is finite.
   - It is difficult to accept this because we seem to have an unexplained want for things to not end. But there is no other explanation for this truth other than it is logically necessary for it to be true. That doesn't remove the sense of mystery though.
- The universe, through the platonic realm, works like a human mind.
   - That is, it is intelligent. It has fine-tuned laws. It has clockwork. All of these seem to suggest the existence of a source of such intelligence. It is mysterious how intelligence could exist outside a human mind. But it is what it is.
