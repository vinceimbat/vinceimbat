I understand that walking is a privilege for those with time, healthy, and limbs to do it. In the evenings, at least in my country, walking as a male is less dangerous than as a female.

But walking is part of a wider spectrum of movement, i. e., being in our bodies, which is necessary to be truly alive and go against the stasis created by a world so inclined in keeping us seated behind bright screens and thinking for as long we can be baited into doing so.
