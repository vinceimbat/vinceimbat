Credibility

- People will only listen if you have credibility.
- How?
   - Do something interesting in real life.
   - And then describe it to us.
- You don’t need to be about one thing.
- Build credibility on anything.
- You don’t need to imagine your target audience first.
- Credibility = Looking at things differently.
- Ratchet up the credibility. -> Use the audience you built to build more credibility in other places.
   - Write about what you went through in life (depression, leaving religion, breakup, tinnitus, Globus) and why you are credible in talking about life.
   - Make a list of experiences to write about
- Gain credibility by documenting what happened to you.
- Write something you went through first-hand. It will build you credibility on that.

Measure of Success

- It’s not followers. Even accounts with millions of followers are not succeeding.
- Better measure: People wanting to hear what you have to say.
- To succeed, you want two things to be happening:
   - People getting something from you.
   - People getting to know you.
- It’s hard to measure.
- But you’ll know when success is happening (people start mentioning you, referring you, word-of-mouth).
- Engagement metrics are a good proxy, but not perfect.
- “Like” is a better metric for engagement (because it has less friction).
- Organic reach - how many people are actually seeing your content.

Make People Find You

- Promote your credibility artifact to communities related to your topic.
- Use only one call to action.
- Reply to other people’s tweets.
   - Use TweetDeck.
   - Turn on tweet notifications (early replies are advantageous).

Bio

- Most important thing:
   - Tell me why I should follow you.
- Weave in your credibility.
   - Pinned tweet one of your artifacts (the most important one, this can be a blog post or try it as a tweet)
   - Bio description
- Tell me what you’ll tweet about.

Real Name vs Pseudonym

- Use an anonymous account if you have no choice.
- Use a pseudonym if you feel strongly about something.
- Don’t waste time to get the perfect catchy name.
- It’s just a small optimization
- Just use your name

How to Tweet

There are exactly two types of tweets:

- Giving something.
- Asking for something.
