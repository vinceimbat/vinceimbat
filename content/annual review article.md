To write an [[Annual review]] article for a given year, do the following:

1. Do this one area at a time.
2. For each area, review the big goals that you set for that particular area.
3. Then, identify the big goals that arose along the way in each area and review them.
4. Make a general assessment on whether or not you performed well in this particular area.
5. Identify and share next big goals.

Be mindful that the current annual review article will be used as a reference to the next annual review article.

The article should be published first through the blog, then newsletter, then social media.
