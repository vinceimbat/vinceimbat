Expectations of the place
Provides a conclusion
Day 1: Indicates he will walk

(Quote)

Description of the route
Walk scene: angry drivers
Trash in the highway
Broken Expectations again
What he found instead: an intersection
Found the campus

(Quote)

Next part: a walk to Atlantic
The bus system
Passengers in the bus
Got off the bus and started walking toward sea
Saw homes, etc.
What he didn't see
Man with iguana

(Quote: Thoreau)

Conversation with students after the walk
Unable to access the beach
Unraveling: Boca Raton was unwalkable
(Parenthetical though: easy to sell drugs here.)
Students don't live in Boca

(Quote)

Talks about the origin of his walking habit
Walking with childhood classmates
Walking home (describes memories of streets)
People he met on his walks
Walking as knowing place intimately

(Quote)

Current: walking to work
Working by walking
Walking as connecting to people
Reflection/Thesis
