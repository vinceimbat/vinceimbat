I saw the sea gull-like bird. I need to identify it. I saw a bush hen, which flew very hard when he sensed me. He flew across the pond. I am not sure if this is the same kind of bush hen we see at home. I feel like the beak of this one is different. I need to know what kinds of bush hen are around the Philippines.

I also saw kingfishers, the same birds I saw in my pond. I miss my pond. I think I need to go back when I get home.
