A well-executed discovery call or meeting will make writing the proposal easier. Specifically, the discovery call should've made it clear to you what the clients most important problems are.

The proposal has the following parts:
1. Headline
2. Introduction
3. Campaign Focus
4. Campaign Strategy
5. Testimonial 1 (Optional)
6. Timeline
7. Deliverables (Optional)
8. Investment
9. Testimonial 2 (Optional)
10. Closing or Agreement

## Headline

A line of text on the top of the proposal or on a separate page telling your prospect what the document is about.

Template: [what campaign] Strategy, Timeline, and Investment for [name of company or owner]

According to best practices, it shouldn't ever be called a proposal.

## Introduction

The introduction has two parts:
1. Context
2. Prospect's problems

Context reminds your prospoect of why they asked for your help.

Template:

>Hey [name]
>
>It was great talking to you yesterday as you explained your vision and plans about [the project in question]. And while it does feel that there’s a lot of work to be done, I am optimistic we can… [insert what they called you for and the expected outcome -- ex: Create a webinar campaign to test the offer out, see how it actually converts, then get it ready for scaling.]

Review the problems your prospect shared to you about including their effects if they continue.

Template:

>Now, in creating this strategy, I took these potential problems into consideration: 
>
>[problem 1, why is it a problem, and what will happen if it continues to be a problem]
>
>[problem 2, why is it a problem, and what will happen if it continues to be a problem]

Tip: Fear of loss will always be more powerful than desire for gain

## Campaign Focus

The campaign focus encapsulates the solution to your prospects problems in one to two paragraphs.

Template:

>Based on those potential problems, I suggest we focus on [what you need to do to solve problem 1], [why the focus on it], [and what’s in it for them if this is solved?]  
>
>And then we [what you need to do to solve problem 2], [why the focus on it], [and what’s in it for them if this is solved?]  
>
>We’ll also [what you need to do to solve problem 3], [why the focus on it], [and what’s in it for them if this is solved?]

## Campaign Strategy

The campaign strategy is a more detailed written form of your offer roadmap. Stress how to get them from A to B in the simplest and shortest path possible.

The strategy has to be only three to five phases. Each phase has to have a title. The title should be written as a simple label or as a benefit or result.

After the title, write some paragraphs highlighting the What and Why. Your prospect does not need to know much of the How. The paragraph must include:
- What you'll do
- Why you need to do it
- What will the prospect gain from it
