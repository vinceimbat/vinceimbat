Just an observation, which could possibly be wrong.

I feel like, in general, nonbelievers are marginalized in society than believers. In a lot of contexts, the nonbelievers are required to show respect to believers (e.g., to not express their doubts or contrarian opinions, to participate in rituals even if they don't believe it as a gesture of respect, etc.). But the same is not asked from believers.

Most believers feel that they have this moral duty to convert non-believers into believing and shun those who constantly refuse to be converted. Meanwhile, most non-believers don't care about what you believe in as long as you don't bother them.

I see this in religion, philosophy, science, politics, and even inside my own family haha.
