In congruence with its [[unitarianism|Unitarian]]  roots, the [[kiitsu kyokai]] advocates supporting social causes. According to [[shinichiro imaoka|Shinichiro Imaoka]], "salvation is both personal and social" and "individual salvation and societal salvation are two sides of the same coin." Therefore, the kiitsu kyokai, like the Unitarian movement, is an enlightenment project that aims to influence not just religion but society in general. Among the objectives of an enlightenment project according to Imaoka are harmonizing science and religion and promoting culture and peace.

The kiitsu kyokai as an organization nurtures [[jiyu shukyo]], which becomes the foundation for all efforts to address societal issues. Although it is an enlightenment project, it is also a religious organization, which means it isn't only for intellectual engagement. Imaoka aspires for the kiitsu kyokai to be a practice ground for the ideal society, where all kinds of people from different walks of life could come together in unity.
