The warmer phase of convalescence arrives when the convalescent finally casts off the last hearth value: the belief that if there were anything of value at all, that value would have to be meta­physically or theologically grounded. To cast that off is to recognize that by abolishing the metaphysical world we have thereby abolished the merely apparent world.
- ==The warm phase begins after throwing reliance to the supernatural and seeing the natural world as it is.
