An evidence that we seem to enter the world with a tabula rasa is the fact that as children, we donâ€™t think about purpose. In fact, [[Existential events or crises compel us to think about purpose]], something a child is incapable of doing simply because a child is incapable of being existentially lost. A child follows what feels good and interesting.

**To Do**
- I encountered some arguments that reject the idea that children arrive with a tabula rasa. Research more on this.
