Your bio is the centerpiece of the narrative that connects the work you create and who you are. Your bio should embody not just a chronological view of your life, but the narratives that fuel you.

Principles
- Start at the present then work yourself backwards.
- Start with what's most important to the reader, not yourself.

To write a bio, follow these steps:

1. Write a belief statement that your ideal reader would read and say “YES! This!”
	1. This statement is a version of your mission statement.
	2. It could express any of the following:
		1. what you are fighting for
		2. what you are fighting against
		3. a feeling that you want people to have when they experience your work
		4. a story that is shorthand for what your audience wants to align with.
2. Write a description of your creative work.
	1. Don't share everything. Just pick the most important parts of your creative work right now.
	2. Don't present a chronology of your creative work.
3. Share your credentials as they relate to your creative work.
	1. These credentials could be public milestones.
	2. But they can also take the form of a story on how you got into your craft or why it matters to you.
4. Share your background and experience filtered through your creative work.
5. Share personal details. Share your hobbies, your hometown, and your background. Only after you've hooked your reader with the narratives that they care about will you share this.
