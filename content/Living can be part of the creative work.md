[[action|Actions]] involved in optimizing [[my life areas]] are necessary to succeed in [[living]]. However, they don't necessarily produce the heightened emotions that we experience in other categories of action like joy or excitement. Optimizing areas can be boring. However, we can deliberately integrate living into our creative work (i.e., how we live is what we use as a subject for our creative work). In this case, living ceases to become a support to the creative work. [[My life areas support my life work]]. They become the creative work itself (see [[to affect the quality of the day thoreau|To affect the quality of the day â€“ Thoreau]]).
