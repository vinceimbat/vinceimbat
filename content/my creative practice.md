My creative practice is the expression of [[my poetics]]. This document will change because how I express my poetics will evolve.

I describe my creative practice based on:

1. How I want to feel + what I want to achieve during and after creation
2. What I want others to achieve and feel after experiencing my creation
3. How my process will achieve the two above

Since I chose jiyū shūkyō to be the guiding force of my poetics, it informs the choices I make in my creative practice.

# Summary

I want my process of creation to be fun—something I look forward to. I also want it to be freeing: it allows me to be myself and follow my curiosities. I want it to make me a better and wiser human being. I want to leave each creative project feeling that the process and its product has enriched my life and those of others. I want my work to nurture faith in my self, my neighbor, nature, and the underlying unity of the universe.

To achieve these, I try to honor the following principles:

1. Try things out but aspire to narrow down the message and method of your work to simplify your life.
2. Continuously trim distractions out of your life.
3. Maintain a daily philosophical practice of reading and writing notes in your [[talahardin]].
4. Maintain a daily contemplative practice that puts you in direct contact with the world (i.e., meditation and walking).
5. Connect daily with readers, peers, and mentors who help nurture your work.
6. Get better at your craft of creating essays, poems, photographs, and books, and bringing them to the right people.

[[My workflow]] is the most important document of my creative practice.

# What I want to feel + achieve

- [[elevate experiences]]
- [[cultivate wisdom]]
- [[have direct impact]]
- [[enjoy community]]
- [[be sustainable]]

# What I want my audience to feel + achieve

My field is the arts and letters ([[a life in letters]]), although my art is heavily informed by my philosophical, religious, and spiritual explorations in [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]].

I want my work to have an effect on the following people:

- [[my ideal audience persona]]
- [[my audience and community]]
- [[my ideal mentors and peers]]

I want my audience to feel and experience the following when engaging with my works:

- movement
- being outdoors in the world
- being in different positions
- [[i want my audience to feel existential|existential]]
- feeling like they want to do something similar
- connection with themselves
- connection with their neighbor
- connection with society
- connection with the nonhuman
