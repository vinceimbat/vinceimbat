A spiritual life needs a lot of space to hear oneself. The maintenance of text and systems could be too much of a burden to my psyche I can no longer hear myself.

If there is an activity I need to increase, it probably is non-thinking. Hours of walking, hours of observation, hours of fishing, hours of photography.
