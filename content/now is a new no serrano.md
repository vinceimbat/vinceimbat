This is [[Vincenz Serrano]]'s first institutionally published book. It is a combination of his earlier works, including [[the collapse of what separates us serrano|The Collapse of What Separates Us]], Itinerary, When a map is folded cities come closer, when clothes are unpacked cities fall apart, and a new collection, which is the title of the book. Vince gave a [[now is a new no walkthrough|Now is a new no walkthrough]] where he discussed how this book was inspired by [[walking]], insights from the social sciences about the fragmented nature of [[manila|Manila]], and aesthetic approaches like [[collage]].
