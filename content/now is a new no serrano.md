This is [[Vincenz Serrano]]'s first institutionally published book. It is a combination of his earlier works like [[the collapse of what separates us serrano|The Collapse of What Separates Us]], Itinerary, When a map is folded cities come closer, when clothes are unpacked cities fall apart, and a new collection, which is the title of the book.
