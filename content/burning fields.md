I miss  
The birds that wake me up  
In sta maria

I miss my room  
The ceiling  
The floor  
The hole on the wall  
Made by my fist

I miss ginawa nen tatay  
And the windows that trembled  
And bled with water when it rained hard

Funny but  
I even miss the noisy neighbor  
The burning fields in the afternoon
