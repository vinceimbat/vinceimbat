One of [[my top three sources of self-actualization]] is [[continued freshness of appreciation]].

Nurturing this source of [[self-actualization]] can be done without the camera ([[transcend without media]]). I can go out, look at objects, and contemplate. However, I argue that [[photography]], and videography by extension, facilitates the nurturing of this strength in a way that makes it easier. This is because, looking for a shot and an angle motivates one to look closer. With a camera, looking closer is inevitable because one has a purpose: to get the best shot. And for someone, who chooses to share their images to the public, this process even becomes more intentional.

All of this contributes to the freshness of appreciation of the objects being looked at.
