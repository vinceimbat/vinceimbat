Religion is the integration of cognitive-affective-conative and even perhaps community. Spirituality is deeply personal. It refers specifically to spiritual experiences, transcendence. One can be religious but not necessarily spiritual (no spiritual experiences) like one can self-actualize without transcending.

So a person who is religious is in a state where his cognitive processes and affective processes align to create actions that are influenced by the two and justifiable by them. Religiousity ends in action. Meanwhile, spirituality is getting to a completely different level that transcends the process of religiosity itself.

Religious activities could generate spiritual experiences. But some spiritual experiences can occur irregardless of religiosity.
