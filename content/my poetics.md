Note: This note is very much a work in progress. The more I understand jiyū shūkyō, the clearer my poetics becomes.
***
My decision to create could only come after my decision to live. This decision is not easy given the circumstances of [[the setting]].

[[A life is the perfect communication]], but within a life is a collection of activities that heighten the desire to communicate. We call this collection, [[art]]. The actions I take that make up what I call my life, which includes my acts of creation, all communicate what I have found in [[my quest]].

My poetics is simply an articulation of a framework that I try to follow when I create. I try to articulate it to express the intricate connection between the act of creative production and the life I seek to live. My poetics is heavily influenced by [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]].

In simple terms, jiyū shūkyō is a creative, inquiring, free, and liberative spirituality. Its subject is the mystery that unifies everything that exists in the setting: the self, the neighbor, the nonhuman, and the universal society that they all make up. Its dream is the realization of a universal cooperative society where the sacredness of self, neighbor, and nonhuman are upheld. Its commitment is an active faith to this mysterious unity, a faith that requires deep listening and openness to change.

# Principles

My poetics is articulated through the following principles.

## Independent

I want to have as much creative freedom as possible. I want to write about topics that I'm deeply interested in. I want to pursue projects that are authentic to who I am. This desire necessitates that I prioritize projects that avoid as much gatekeeping as possible. Therefore, much of the work I produce is self-published material.

## Pleasurable

I want to enjoy the creative process. I use curiosity and pleasure as guide to how I choose the next project and the next tasks to take on. This requires that my structures are flexible enough to allow experiencing pleasure when doing work.

## Subsistent

 My projects require little to no financing. If there is any need for funding, the money comes from my own pocket or from the generous support of my community. The creative artifacts created from the process are also lean and bootstrapped. Most of them will be shared for free and those that shall be sold shall be low cost. Earnings from these projects are used to support new ones making my creative process as self-sustainable as possible.

## Communal

While some projects require solitude, the creative artifacts that come from these projects are meant to be shared with a community, for free or supported through low costs. Their design and distribution are meant to build real connections between me and my audience. Some walking projects will also involve groups, giving way to a more direct communal experience.

## Existential

I want my creative process to elevate my experience, and I want my creative artifacts to help my audience value their own experiences. I want to elicit emotions that oridinary objects and experiences are deeply meaningful.

## Liberative

My work espouses a radical partiality to change. My creative process liberates me from the constraints of culture and the outside world but is also liberative to others. The positions I take on work is inquring, freeing, and ever-changing.

I apply these principles in [[my creative practice]].
