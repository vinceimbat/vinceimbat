My main purpose of articulating my poetics is to express the tight connection between the act of creative production and the spiritual life I seek to live. In clarifying the issues scoped by this document, I hope I could continue to enjoy a creative life aligned with my values. This project was partly inspired by the work of [[hundred rabbits|Hundred Rabbits]].

My [[poetics]] heavily relies on [[my worldview|my worldview]] and [[my quest|my quest]].

I describe my poetics based on:
1. How I want to feel + what I want to achieve during and after creation
2. What I want others to achieve and feel after experiencing my creation
3. How my process will achieve the two above

# Summary

I want my process of creation to be funâ€”something I look forward to. I also want it to be freeing: it allows me to be myself and follow my curiosities. I want it to make me a better and wiser human being. I want to leave each creative project feeling that the process and its product has enriched my life and those of others. I want my work to nurture faith in my self, my neighbor, nature, and the underlying unity of the universe.

To achieve these, I try to honor the following principles:

1. Try things out but aspire to narrow down the message and method of your work to simplify your life.
2. Continuously trim distractions out of your life.
3. Maintain a daily philosophical practice of reading and writing notes in your talahardin.
4. Maintain a daily contemplative practice that puts you in direct contact with the world (i.e., meditation and walking).
5. Connect daily with readers, peers, and mentors who help nurture your work.
6. Get better at your craft of creating essays, poems, photographs, and books, and bringing them to the right people.

# What I want to feel + achieve

- [[elevate experiences]]
- [[cultivate wisdom]]
- [[have direct impact]]
- [[enjoy community]]
- [[be sustainable]]

# What I want my audience to feel + achieve

I want my work to have an effect on the following people:

- [[my ideal audience persona]]
- [[my audience and community]]
- [[my ideal mentors and peers]]

My field is the arts and letters ([[a life in letters]]). But my art is heavily informed by my spiritual explorations in [[jiyu shukyo]].

Being Filipino, my audience will primarily be Filipinos. But I still want to converse with an international audience because I engage with universal topics.

My goal: [[i want my audience to feel existential|I want my audience to feel existential]].
