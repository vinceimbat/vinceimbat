Note: This note is very much a work in progress. The more I understand jiyū shūkyō, the clearer my poetics becomes.
***

My decision to create could only come after my decision to live. This decision is not easy given the circumstances of [[the setting]].

[[A life is the perfect communication]], but within a life is a collection of activities that heighten the desire to communicate. We call this collection, [[art]]. The actions I take that make up what I call my life, which includes my acts of creation, all communicate what I have found in [[my quest]] to understand the universe and how to be in it.

My poetics is simply an articulation of a framework that I try to follow when I create. I try to articulate it to express the intricate connection between the act of creative production and the life I seek to live. My poetics is heavily influenced by [[jiyu shukyo|jiyū shūkyō]].

In simple terms, jiyū shūkyō is a creative, inquiring, free, and liberative spirituality. Its subject is the mystery that unifies everything that exists in the setting: the self, the neighbor, the nonhuman, and the universal society that they all make up. Its dream is the realization of a universal cooperative society where the sacredness of self, neighbor, and nonhuman are upheld. Its commitment is an active faith to this mysterious unity, a faith that requires deep listening and openness to change.
