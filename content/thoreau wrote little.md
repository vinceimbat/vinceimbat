Thoreau’s literary production was limited.

- Thoreau was not merely a writer. He was a poet—one who receives and communicates truth.
- If all that a man writes must be truth, his production will be limited.
- Thoreau revised endlessly to clarify his thoughts and experiences in his own mind, reducing them to their essence, and to eliminate rather than to achieve style.
- He reduced the communication to essentials.
- Transcendental conviction: "the matter is all in all, and the manner nothing at all."
