Research question: What is the best way to improve my editing and proofreading skills fast and cheap?

## Brenner, E. (2022, February 17). For editors, by editors. *Right Touch Editing*. https://www.righttouchediting.com/2022/02/17/for-editors-by-editors/

This is a list of editorial training run by editors. Most of the courses linked her are paid although a few are also free.

## Chartered Institute of Editing and Proofreading. (2023). Curriculum for professional development for editors and proofreaders. https://www.ciep.uk/assets/files/public/Curriculum-for-professional-development_v1.5.pdf

This curriculum divides an editor's work life into three domains:
1. Working as a professional
2. Editorial knowledge and practice
3. Specialist skills and knowledge

For my project, domain teo is the most relevant.

## Editors Canada. (2019). Career builder. https://www.editors.ca/sites/default/files/editorscanada-careerbuilder.pdf

This guide suggests a three-step plan
1. Become part of the community of editors by networking.
2. Augment your previous education and enhance your skills.
3. Build your portfolio by finding work.

Since my goal is to improve my editorial and proofreading skills so I could land a platform agency job by April or May 2023, I am going to skip steps 1 and 3 for now and all advice about the business side of editorial freelancing.

On enhancing one's skills, the guide advices that editors should take courses on punctuation, grammar, and style. It also advices on taking courses on querying, electronic editing, Word styles, and professional editorial standards, such as Editors Canada's own PES 2016.

Later down the road, the guide advices that editors should start finding out what they are good at and what they enjoy doing and focus on these. There are four editorial disciplines to specialize in:
- copy editing
- structural editing
- stylistic editing
- proofreading

For general editing, the guide also suggests that editors invest in learning about:
- editing for the web
- plain language
- fact checking
- syntax
- usage

It also suggests being familiar with tools and techniques, such as:
- advanced Word
- design for editors
- editing PDFs
- style guides

For more advanced training, the guide suggests learning about:
- citation
- macros
- manuscript evaluation
- SEO
- medical, government, and other specialty areas

## Hart, G. J. S. (2005). Improving your editing efficiency: Software skills, soft skill, and survival skills. https://www.geoff-hart.com/articles/2005/efficiency.htm

Hart argues that editors should aspire for efficiency by nurturing software skills, soft skills, and survival skills.

### Software skills

Hart suggest that editors should review their processes and identify two kinds of tasks:
1. Infrequent time-consuming tasks
2. Frequent quick tasks

Once identified, software should be used to do them.

Some suggestions Hart gave are:
- Write a collection of standard queries that you routinely ask to authors and use a text expander to expand a shortcut you will use into the query. Write the query in a gentler way that provides a complete explanation of the problem and its potential solution. Alternatively, write these standard queries in a file that you can copy paste manually. For example, use this when querying missing citations.
- Use macros for routine cleanups to remove double spaces, double paragraph returns, and other spacing problems.

Hart suggests that editors should create a list of all these annoying tasks and invest some time in learning how to use software to solve each of them in a regular basis, for example, once a week.

Hart suggests that editors should create templates for standardized write ups of their writers. To do so:
1. Type all required headings and style accordingly.
2. Add a one sentence prompt, styled correctly, that the writer can use to start writing on the section.
3. Add subheading and bulleted lists if necessary.

Hart argues that editors should propose solutions and not just report problems. Further, editors should make their solutions easy to adopt by highlighting the results and not the steps that led to the results. To do so, Hart suggests the following:
- Retype an entire misspelled word.
- Copy a complicated sentence or paragraph into a comment and edit it there rather than retyping words form scratch. When authors copy your solution from the comment to the main text, they introduce fewer mistakes into the manuscript.

Hart also suggests mastering search and replace to fit your needs.

On a related note, Hart emphasizes the benefits of using a style sheet. In the style sheet, indicate the preferred choice and the forbidden variants. Then search for each forbidden variant and replace them with the preffered choice.

Hart also suggests learning how to use spellcheckers effectively by using custom and exclusion dictionaries.
- A custom dictionary can be used for each project.
- An exception dictionary can be used to flag correctly spelled words that couuld become mistyped versions of another word. For example: "pubic health" vs. "public health," which vs. that, affect vs. effect.

Hart also suggests to do a single spellcheck at the end of editing to save time.

### Soft skills

Hart provides useful insights that editors should keep in mind when working with authors, specifically when writing queries and limiting the scope of their revisions. Hart's advice are as follows:
- Develop a soft touch and always encourage a friendly author–editor collaboration, being mindful that authors have fragile egos and the editing process can be easily seen as adversarial.
- Before beginning work, learn about the goals of the author and agree on the scope of the revision based on those goals. When working, stay within the limits of that scope and focus on what is important to the author.
- Always empathize with the author. Begin a project by preparing the author for what to expect. Clearly state that you plan on focusing on their needs and remind them that your focus will be looking for problems so your edits will provide a negative impression of the work. You can also ask them how you can make the editing process easier for them. For example, teach them to print manuscripts with revisions or create a primer on Word's revision tracking system.
- Always make things easier for your author. Do this by asking your authors about the problems they face in the writing process and providing solutions to them that save time and effort. For example, you could offer to help them create detailed and effective outlines before they write (developmental editing). This will make your job as editor easier later on.
- Persuade authors to accept your edits by using tactful language that frames queries into requests rather than demands. Use words like "please" and "kindly". Explain problems from your standpoint and do not attack the author.
- Suggest reasonable changes and justify these changes.
- Conclude and return your revisions on a positive note by giving an honest compliment.
- Emphasize your willingness to work with the author to arrive at a mutually satisfactory revision.

### Survival skills

Hart advices to adjust your schedule as an editor based on the weekly, monthly, and annual rhythms of your clients.

Also, editors should learn their own rhythms. For example, editors should perfom high-level, intellectually demanding editing tasks like substantive rewrites when they are most alert (like mornings), while reserving mindless tasks like editing citations and formatting bibliographies when they are less alert (like after lunch).

Hart also suggests the following process when editing:
1. Edit errors that prevent readers from understanding the text (e.g., factual or logical errors).
2. Edit errors that make comprehension difficult.
3. Polish prose: eliminate typos and incoherence.

Hart also provides other time-saving advice:
- Accept "good enough" edits when you know that you'll see the manuscript again for a second review.
- Don't waste time trying to understand a difficult problem. Get moving and return to that section once other pages are done and you may have a better grasp of the problem. This applies a lot when revising the title or editing an abstract or summary.
- Identify your editing bottlenecks and spend time learning about the problem and at least one solution. Further, try to implement a system to review these solutions repeatedly until you memorize them.

Hart also suggests creating your own innovative solutions for problems and sharing them with others.

Lots of dead links.
Materials are old and un-updated.

In the page Education and Certification, there is this quote from Helen Schinskie about the value of formal training:
>I think training did give me a leg up in a lot of ways. I had done a good deal of desultory proofreading and editing before going in for a formal certificate program, but the class work really consolidated and clarified a lot of ideas I'd been a bit vague on before. I'd never really had proper feedback on what I was doing—either there wasn't time or the customer didn't know any better than I did. In fact, I'd been doing a lot of things right, but it was a great relief to know they were right and to get official credit for what I knew. I also made a bunch of local connections in the business that have been quite important to me.
>
>Probably nine-tenths of the benefit was psychological; if I'd had more chutzpah, I could have done just as well on my own. All the same, I really liked being part of a community of editors, and I liked getting pats on the back from my teachers. I came out of the training much more confident in my own ability to adapt and find my feet in the freelance world.

The general consensus among editors seems that training and experience are both necessary.
