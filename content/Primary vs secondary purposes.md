According to [[Eckhart Tolle]], there are two kinds of purposes: the [[Primary purpose]] and the [[Secondary purpose]]. Human being's primary purpose is to be present in whatever they do. This is a purpose about quality of action. The secondary purpose refers to anything one wants to do. It is a purpose concerning content.

For Eckhart Tolle, primary purpose is always primary, and this purpose is everchanging because when we are concsciously moving, we know where each of our actions are going and we focus on that, we are present on that. In other words, the journey towards the fulfillment of a secondary purpose is the primary purpose. The secondary purpose, which describes an [[End state]], becomes primary when it finally reaches the Now.

The state of concsiousness is primary; everything else is secondary.

That said, [[We can live without articulating our purpose]].

**To do**

- It is time to challenge this. Do I still accept this in my worldview?
