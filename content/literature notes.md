Literature notes are lightweight highlights and annotations collected while reading or consuming information. Their extensiveness depend on the complexity of the text and our ability to write concisely. They should serve only as reminders and should not be too broad. They just have to be “good enough” notes that could recreate your mental context when you are reading.

In [[Ahren's Zettelkasten Manual]], literature notes are separated from the [[thoughts/evergreens]] and stored in a [[Reference management system]] like [[Zotero]] together with bibliographic details. In my [[talahardin]], I separate them from permanent notes by putting them in a separate folder: the [[writing inbox]].

To collect them based on media, see [[how to write literature notes]]. To use them to write permanent notes, see [[how to convert literature notes to permanent notes]].
