When you [[write permanent notes about what you read to test understanding]], you transform what you read into an original artifact that is your own. The [[evergreens]] in your [[talahardin]] develop into original arguments shaped by the mental models you have stored in your brain. Vice versa, the mental models you have are changed by the things you read and take note of. This is why, when you [[grow the talahardin to complexity]], you also grow your thinking. The connections there also develop the connections in our brain. What’s more, [[Talahardin improves memory]] about our ideas and those of others because they are now embedded in a latticework (see [[spaced repetition]]).
