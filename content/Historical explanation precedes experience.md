There are some instances when explanation is necessary first before deep experience is possible. I experience this with historical knowledge relating to specific geographic space. I can be in the space and experience it as it is but I can only experience it based on its now-ness. But when I record its history, I see it differentlyâ€”sometimes, entirely differently, because the now-ness is almost disconnected fromt its historicity.

Reading or learning about the history of a place which has dramatically changed is like being introduced to an entirely different thing, thus the novelty can produce a similar effect (or even more profound) as the place at its present state has triggered us.
