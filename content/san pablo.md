The destination of my long walk from [[los banos|Los Ba√±os]] on 2022, which became the essay that landed me a spot at the [[ANWW20]] called [[Traversing Liminality Through Walking]].

San Pablo's main attraction is the [[Sampaloc Lake]].

San Pablo is [[Rofel Brion]]'s hometown and this is where [[saglit brion|Saglit]] was launched, the last day I was with [[rem tanauan|Rem Tanauan]].
