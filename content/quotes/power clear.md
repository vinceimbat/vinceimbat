"Explore life from a position of power. 

When you believe, *"Even if I stay single, I'll still have a great life"* ... then you are in a much better position to enter a relationship. 

When you believe, *"Even if I don't get into this school, I'll still have a great life"* ... then you are in a much better position to apply. 

When you believe, *"Even if I don't succeed with this business, I'll still have a great life"* ... then you are in a much better position to give it a try. 

Sure, you may want the relationship to work or the business to be a success—and you should give it your best effort—but also realize that if it doesn't work out, you'll be fine. There are many ways to live a great life."
