It is not that we love to be alone, but that we love to soar, and when we do soar, the company grows thinner and thinner until there is none at all. …We are not the less to aim at the summits though the multitude does not ascend them.

Translation
- Hindi naman sa gusto natin parating mapag-isa; gusto lang nating lumipad.
- Hindi sa mahilig tayong mapag-isa; kundi gustung-gusto lang talaga nating lumipad.
