Book for spiritual reading.

"a surge from the heart"

He wrote books as if he was a spiritual director or a spiritual doctor. He answered questions people pose.

Relating other people's questions to questions he asked himself.

When people read writings about spirituality, they expect you to be transparent.
- Example: Journals of Thomas Merton - narrative theology
- The writing has to remind the reader that the author struggles and that there's nothing to be embarrased about
- Strive to create a bond with your reader
- Consciously choose to be the "wounded prayer" to lead others; but not too much of yourself in. Bring other voices.

examination of conscience vs examination of consciousness

examination of conscience (the examine) = review of the day

Check: George Ashton Brenner
- Examination of conscience has moralistic overtones.
- He preferred "examination of consciousness"
- the "examine" is okay

Frame prayer as a process that everyone can do.

"The Life You Save May Be Your Own"

A prayer can be a journal entry using casual language talking to God.

"prayerful prose"

Anything that formalizes your connection to "God" is prayer. Doesn't have to be fancy.

Merton: "I don't know if I really become a true monk, or a true contemplative, but what I do know, is that I am a writer, that I was one before I enter the monastery. I'm still one, and then I'm gonna remain one."

Martin identifies himself as a Jesuit who happens to write.
- His "ministry of writing" and "vocation of writing" flows out of his work as a Jesuit: his desire to get people closer to God.
- Writing is one way he does it.
- Writing is his ministry, so he gets up in the morning and starts writing

Daily routine
- wake up
- prayer - he prays at his entire ministry and not just writing
- write - he imagines the reader; he intends to write something that will "help souls"
- research
- social media

When he is working on a book, he is so fascinated with its topic. Then he loses that interest as he ends the book.

Writing practice

- He writes to help souls: not for art.

God in all things
- not just in writing
- he does many other things

He never struggles with writing, which shows in his prose. It isn't elegant.

He likes Hemingway as a writer.

He writes in a simple way, to communicate.
- E. B. White? Thoreau?

"Open your vein and let it come out." - not for him. He enjoys writer.

Try to make writing the pleasurable time of the day, a time for imaginative freedom.

Poetics: The act of making the work is "spiritualized."

Writing = happy, consoling (this is how he thinks his writing is spiritualized)

He wants to write clear and distinct (not beautiful) sentences.

How is the pressure in writing gone?
- Vow of poverty: Not writing to make a living.
- Not writing for a career.
- Not writing for reviewers.
- Not writing as an academic.

He writes what he wants, fast as he wants, no worry about how many books he sells.

Nothing assigned.

Writing and prayer are closely aligned.

Don't make your spiritual writing vague like most of it is.

Difference between spiritual journals, retreat writing, and Martin's writing?
- In journals, you don't edit. You're not editing.
- Journaling is important practice: record of your spiritual insights.

Merton knew that his journals would eventually be read. He gave up on any sense of an absolute private life. That said, Merton was able to forget about his audience moment to moment and be free as a writer.

Must everyone like you? Let go of the need to be liked by everyone.

You always need some structure, some regularity.
