There is no such thing as a best camera. The best camera is the best for your needs.

Here are the important steps to take before buying a camera.

1. **Define your budget.** Decide whether to get a budget (Php 20-30k), mid-range (Php 30-60k), or high-end (Php 60k+). If you are just starting out, start with a budget model because you don't need that much features and the amount of money you spend on a camera will not make you a better photographer. You are in a budget, buy secondhand then invest in better lenses.
2. **Choose the type of camera.** Decide whether you want a compact, bridge, DSLR, or mirrorles. The most imortant thing to have is a camera with a manual mode and whose lenses are interchangeable.
3. **Consider the size of your kit.** The most important factor here is sensor size. Sensor size determines the size of the camera and the accessories that go with it. There are three types of sensors: full frame (35 mm), crop (22 mm), and micro 4:3 (17 mm). The bigger the sensor the more detailed the image, but the bigger the camera and its accesories will be. There are cameras that try to minimize the size of the sensor without compromising its power (e.g. Canon M50).
4. **Consider image quality.** This is related to the previous point. If you want more detail then you will need a bigger sensor and, therefore, camera and accessories. When you are just starting out, you don't need a large camera.
5. **Choose the right brand.** Choose a brand that a friend or family is using so that you can ask for their help.
6. **Consider filming.** If you need to film using your camera, aspire for an ability to shoot in 4k with 60 fps.
7. **Consider where to buy.** You can buy in person or online. It is best to hold the camera before buying, so go to a shop to hold it even if you are buying online. When you buy secondhand, buy at well-established secondhand companies, look for something with a low shutter count and not thirdhand.
