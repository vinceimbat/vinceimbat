Poetry is about being as intentional as one can be with one's words. Being economical. Minimalistic. About how one can transmit meaning with as little tools as one can.

I think all writers ought to be poets or at least try to be one.

Essays on the other hand are where we try. Where we can be more free.

Genre-less writing is of course not concerned about these genres. It is about freedom.

From [[Martin Villanueva]]:

>A poem is a place to find unknown connections.
