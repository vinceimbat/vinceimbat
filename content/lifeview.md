A lifeview is your ideas about the world and how it works. It answers the following questions:

- Why are we here?
- What is the meaning or purpose of life?
- What gives life meaning?
- What makes your life worthwhile or valuable?
- What is the relationship between the individual and others?
- Where do family, country, and the rest of the world fit in?
- How does your life relate to others in your family, your community, and the world?
- What do money, fame, and personal accomplishment have to do with a satisfying life?
- How important are experience, growth, and fulfillment in your life?
- What is good, and what is evil?
- Is there a higher power, God, or something transcendent, and if so, what impact does this have on your life?
- What is the role of joy, sorrow, justice, injustice, love, peace, and strife in life?

Here is [[My lifeview]].

According to [[Designing Your Life - Burnett and Evans]], a lifeview is a necessary complement to a [[workview]] in creating one's life compass. A well-designed life has a bias towards coherence between your lifeview and your [[workview]]. To find this coherence, ask the following questions:

- Where do your views on work and life complement one another?
- Where do they clash?
- Does one drive the other? How?
