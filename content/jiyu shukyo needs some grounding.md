To create a subsistent spirituality, have a few rules to ground yourself (bind yourself).

No rules but a few grounding ones:

- support pluralism
- avoid emphasis on separation

Religion = religare = to bind

It is a spectrum
1. Bind too much (no freedom)
2. Minimalist binding (a few rules to ground oneself and to guide group)
3. No binding (illusory absolute freedom, no regard to others, takes all welcomes all)

The rules that bind jiyu shukyo may be best internalized rather than treated like laws.
