Prestige is fame among a particular group of people.

Even if a person’s motive for fame is to set a positive example, it mirrors the other, less flattering motives insofar as it depends on other people’s opinions.

fame is not found within ourselves but based on what scholars [call](https://doi.org/10.1002/mar.20554) extrinsic rewards, which research overwhelmingly shows bring less happiness than intrinsic rewards.

Fame has been a form of addiction, and social media facilitates this.

No social scientists I am aware of have created a quantitative misery index of fame. But the weight of the indirect evidence above, along with the testimonies of those who have tasted true fame in their time, should be enough to show us that it is poisonous.
