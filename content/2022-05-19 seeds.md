A dog tied on the door barks at a cat - a feral cat, as if to express his envy of the former's freedom.

Like most things in nature, the things that move catch our eyes before those that don't, and so I didn't catch his hands first as they were steady straight, but only noticed him after a car ran over his bike's wheel and he flew up the air.

I shouldn't be tired of sharing about my day. I should be thrilled to have the opportunity to tell a story out of my day even if it is boring. It forces me to find meaning, create meaning out of the mundane. To look at this walk and feel grateful that I am able to do it. To elevate the value of each day.
