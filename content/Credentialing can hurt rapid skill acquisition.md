Rapidly acquiring a skill or knowledge requires a significant amount of autonomy to determine your own learning objectives and choosing paths towards those objectives. Credentialing, with its stringent curriculums and requirements, is easily antithetical to rapid learning. One-size-fits-all learning programs that make meeting requirements the most important goal could force one to spend more time on the wrong things (like areas where one is already significantly proficient) especially passive learning rather than deliberately practicing your skill or using knowledge in a context of use.

The primary problem is opportunity cost: if the requirements to obtain the credential are so intense that they impair your ability to spend time practicing the skills in question, credentialing programs can do more harm than good.
