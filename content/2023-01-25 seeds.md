- [[Altruism encourages trust and courage]]

When we help people in need, it becomes easier for others to trust others.

Right now, I feel afraid and find it difficult to trust and have faith because the world around me has valorized individualism and capitalism - be independent, do not rely on others. I think we shouldn't put a burden on other and do our best to contribute to bread labor but in times of deep need, I think we should be able to feel courage and trust. This is so difficult to do right now.
