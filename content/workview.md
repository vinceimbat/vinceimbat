According to [[Designing Your Life - Burnett and Evans]], workview is your philosophy of work. It states what work means to you in general. It defines what good work deserves to be. However, it is not a job description.

A workview answers the following questions.

- Why work?
- Whatâ€™s work for?
- What does work mean?
- How does it relate to the individual, others, society?
- What defines good or worthwhile work?
- What does money have to do with it?
- What do experience, growth, and fulfillment have to do with it?

According to Burnett and Evans, a workview is a necessary complement to a [[lifeview]] in creating one's life compass.

Here is [[My workview]].
