The human body, mind, and even the things around us are syncretic. The law of nature is impurity. This implies that culture is also impure. Language, perhaps the most vital and potent element of culture will always be impure. The law of nature is interdependence. Our response to this metaphysical fact is a dynamic approach to all aspects of life, that is to say, to go with the flow of life. This is the easier path.

It seems like the rules that make life difficult to some of us are all brought by this desire for purity. Abstinence before marriage is an attempt for purity. Religious discrimination against the LGBTQ+ is from this desire for purity. Rules against the intermarriage of people from one religion to another are against impurity. Rules against reading or consuming literature from contradictory beliefs or religions are attempts to keep faiths pure. Although unrelated, the desire to purify language use also arises from this.
