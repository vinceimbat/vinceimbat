I write to live. I write because I'm at my best when I'm writing. I write because it is who I am and what I do. I write because it connects me with the world. It is my excuse to read. I become a better writer when I read. But recently, I'm writing because I want to be better and I'm in a continuous pursuit of getting better. I write to be brave, to choose life, and friendship, to walk daily, and to be grateful for everything I am gifted. I write to teach myself of things I'm unfamiliar of. I write to chase all the words I haven't said and heard in the past. I write to redeem myself of who I have not become. I write because it is the only thing I know, the only way I know to live in a more beautiful world.
