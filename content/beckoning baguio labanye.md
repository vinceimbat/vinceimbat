I was four years out of [[Baguio]] when [[Ivan Labanye]] started writing these columns in 2018, but for some reason, a measure of nostalgia creeps from every page of Ivan's writing. I have a feeling that anyone who've had the opportunity to call Baguio a home for at least a year will feel the same feeling when reading anything written about Baguio.

Ivan was just a year ahead of me. He came to UPB in 2007; I in 2008. And that is why his face is very familiar, in that small world that is UPB. It is a shame, though, that while Ivan was developing his writing voice and the activism that propels it, and still is very much felt in these essays from 2018 onwards, our paths never coincided. From 2008 to 2011, I was deep into my evangelical ministry, when I was still a Jesus Jesus person, while my last two years in Baguio was an immersion to interpreting/political work with the Deaf community of Baguio.

Now as I read Ivan's book, the only thing that I now, somehow connects us all those years is the ambulation. The streets that Ivan's feet knows were the same streets I knew and still knows. And with a funy turn of cosmic events, our ambulations brought us to Los Ba√±os, where we both live now and where our meeting is finally ripe for the making.
