Garlic vine flower buds  
a second before they bloom  
remind me of your  
untouched lips.  

17:29  

A red car  
parked over fresh  
green grass  
is a lady resting.  

17:35  

A slow afternoon,  
trike drivers patiently waiting,  
as if it was an hour before  
the bombs were dropped in 1945.  

17:41  

I saw him once more  
the tall deaf boy  
on his bike, envying him  
for the silence he holds forever.  

17:43  

In the midst of a crowd  
with fancy dresses  
I walked when you blew me  
a kiss wrapped in smoke.  

18:00  

This lovely green car  
reminds me of a snake  
out in the open after months  
in the undergrowth.  

18:27  

You have what they covet  
but in their desire to see it  
they can't help  
but to laugh at you.  

18:44  

The trees told me  
to stop looking at their shadows  
because to look at their shadows  
is to look at them.  

19:25  

When fireflies hover  
around a lamppost  
are they blinded that they  
can't see how beautiful they are?  

Alternative:  

do their tiny mouths blaze in joy?  

do they also dream they can shine as bright as it?
