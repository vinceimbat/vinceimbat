If these trees  
at Bagong Silang  
don't meet above me  
I just might see  
a cloud or two  
moving fast  
above these towering giants.  

Deep in the forest,  
sometimes I dream  
that all these branches fall  
along with these leaves  
and the sky lie open.  

But then I see a stump  
feel sorry for the tree that  
once stood on it  
and forgive myself of  
my initial thought.
