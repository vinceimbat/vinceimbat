On the surface
of this deep, hollow well,
I see coins
dropped by someone's
longing some years ago,
pebbles thrown by boredom
by a random child.

Alas,
I see Andrew's face, smiling,
Rem's closed eyes, at peace,
Pearl's earnestness,
My mom and dad's trust.

I see Gripo's
dark furred face
(that poor dog)
I see Oreo.

And then
the water is clear
once more
shapes of coins
and pebbles
piercing their way out
of the transparent liquid.

I was left there
staring at them
for a little while longer
before I too
took my own face
out of that deep, hollow well.
