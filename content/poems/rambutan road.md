The moon  
three-fourths lit  
shines high up  
in this early  
evening sky.  

A rice cake stuck  
on a sepia wall  
bitten by  
a hungry lover  
on his way out.  

I cross the bridge  
after Ela with  
an invisible bird  
flying behind me  
singing.  

But all I could think of  
are possible stories  
of how a piece of cold  
heartless cement  
could be named after  
that sweetest  
of all summer fruits.  

# To do

I'm not completely sold to the last stanza.
