I looked for you  
You weren't there  
I secretly hope you lived  
Or someone else  
Someone braver  
Have taken you in  
To watch your last breath  

I walked away from where I first saw you  
Still hearing  
Your piercing cry  
I raised my head up the sky  
Two nimbus clouds raced  
On the back of the wind  
The dark chasing them  

I forgive myself  
I forgive myself
