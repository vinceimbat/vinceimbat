I had a friend  
Who once walked  
This bridge  
Many more times than I did  
Many more times than I ever will  
Or so I wish  

If she walked on this  
Never-ending bridge  
On that summer night  
She might still be here with us  
Still walking  
Still walking  
Never-ending  
Here  

And yet  
She walked  
Not on this bridge  
But into that godforsaken bus  
Sat on that godforsaken chair  
Where she left  
All of us  

At the middle of this bridge  
I stop  

To look up at the sky  
And wonder  
How often did Gy  
Looked up  
At the moon  
To see it as if for the last time  

I hope she did  
Oh, I hope she did  
As often as she can  

I walk pass the bridge  
Farther towards the park  
And see them benches  

Did she giggled too  
On one of these  
Surrounded by friends  
As she imitates  
An actress perhaps  
Or did so  
Out of nature  

We still hear her laughs  

Or did she  
Followed her solitude sometimes  
Sitting on the new grass  
Away from everyone  
As the wind blew  
On her polished face  

I hope she did  
Oh, I hope she did  
As often as she can  

Because  
If Gy walked on  
That never-ending bridge  
On that summer night  
We won't be talking  
About her this way  
Missing her  
Writing poems for her  
Remembering her  
Once a year  
On her birthday  

For she  
Like all of us  
Like most of us  
Young and strong  
And still many years ahead  

Will still be here  

But instead  
She walked into that bus  
Not on that bridge  

I hope she did  
Oh, I hope she did
