Mormons  

Bicycles, dogs, boys  

Vines, bougainvillea wrap around wires  
A tree with no leaves  
The same boys throw stones on a black dog  

An old lady with trash on her trike  
A youngster helps her  
Gangsters  

She may have blown her right back wheel  
She checks her spare  

She just had a bath  
And looks at the car's mirror to see her face  
A movie and coffee  
The dog sleeps on top of a pile of sand  
Double deal  
2 regular pizzas 499  

And he begins his rounds  
To collect debts unpaid  
Goes back  
May have forgotten something  
Or the debtor is not in there  
Pakiusap  
Hwag-tapunan  
Basura canal  
Can't remember when I last saw the sun  
He made a joke about him  
The others laughed  
I smell the dog needs a bath  

Green plastic fences  
What can they do really to protect these plants?  

?  

The rambutab fruits are late  
Tuko!  
Apatot  
The coolest weirdest pigeon house  
I smell wet paint, cigarretes, and burnt coconut  
The messiness of this walk begins  
Too many cars  

La Anicia  
Badminton kids  
The kingdom hall  
A coffee machine  
Bushes blockibg the little side walk i have  

She walks as if she could die tomorrow  
Chicken beside church  
I drink buko  
Pares too soupy  
He sleeps at the doorstep of a shoe shop  

Empty jollibee trash bins  
A bookshop i've never visited  
Too many breads when were they last finished  
A chicken roasted store beside a chapel  
She breaths vape and swallows it while walking  
These yet to be moved electric posts shield us from speedy vehicles  
A big tooth hangs on a second floor balcony  
Electric bikes  
A bus opens and they go down only to ride another one a few hours from now  
I might find my death one day on this road  
An ambulance appears out of nowhere  
That grilled tilapia is heaven  
Grazing motherfucking tables  
Looked at my left and saw a large woman in read walking beside me  
Pedestrians are protected when they cross and take their chances  
Not when walking sidewalks  

Night at maahas road  
Can I walk here without dying?  
Goto batangas beside an online variety shop  
Writing or my life?  
Still open but he watches the news  
Maralika fund act now a law  
Including my desire to get home alive  
Durian and tusok  
She moved her Umbrella so we can both fit on the sidewalk  
A dance school without music  
I trust my life with their lights  
Crumpled bottle of water  
I stepped on mud  
Suddenly weight on my left feet  
I opened my phone's flash light  
And I see the railway  
I cross it and no train  
No people  

A thick mist covers Makiling  
The rural comes  
Like Sta. Maria  
Dark Sta. Maria  
Alone I am  
Like this firefly  
Both of us pedestrians of life  
As I walk, harde ed soil leaves my flipflops  
And land on my neck  
What? This was a rotonda all along?  

Jogger selfies  
A solar powered seed bank looks like a food cart with open roofs   but no vendors  
I smell perfume  
He cam out of my left  
He was the one I came across a while ago  
A walker  
I sat down to call  
Dinner at Janges no energy to buy and cook food  
Lamposts from a far blinking like car lights  
I entrust my life to them
