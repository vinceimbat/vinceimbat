What is it like to walk under a thunderstorm?  
It is like nothing can stop you.  
But also like being an unfortunate prey  
Of A ? stalker with a really bad temper but also excellent photographic skills  
It is like someone somewhere has decided to take your photo repeatedly and you can't stop him.  
And then he gets mad and makes it known when you don't get it right.  
And you hide, cover your ears, flee naturally because you are afraid.  
But this makes him even angrier.  
And occasionally, when you really piss him off  
He lets out this really loud angry call that would deafen ur ears and swear to god you wouldn't ever ever get out of a thunderstorm again.  
But before u can do that  
You have to find your way first under the sea of blood  
The pool and whatever that angry stalker left on his way.
