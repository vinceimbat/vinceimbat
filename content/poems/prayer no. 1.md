Sitting there on that tiny chair across her,
I babbled words
like a platoon commander,
her eyes teary on both ends.

I felt the need to stop
but my chest won't let me
and my mouth went on
and on until both had had enough.

Until both had me raise my head
to stare at the ceiling briefly
before I shut my eyes close
to stay there in that darkness

for as long as I can
and muddle on that silence
that I knew she needed,
that I most definitely needed.

A silence that painted an image
of me barricading myself
inside an arrow of words,
a metal shield of callousness.
