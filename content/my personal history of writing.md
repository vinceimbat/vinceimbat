Like [[henry david thoreau|Thoreau]], like [[ralph waldo emerson|Emerson]], my first allegiance is to the spiritual life. To me, as I currently understand it, this is a life whose primary trade is an earnest exploration of what humanity shares: the mystery of existence and life.

My writings are still not of this quality. I haven't focused. They are still divergent. But I need to give myself some slack. The core of [[my poetics]] of [[writing as spiritual practice martin|writing as spiritual practice]] has been here, growing organically from 2011 to 2023, with the bulk of my growth from 2014 (when I discovered blogging) to 2022 when I began associating with writers who are also into spirituality. I started serious journaling. I fell in love with Thoreau, note-taking, etc.

This almost solipsistic writing life was shattered by an exposure to the literary community at [[ANWW20]]. Suddenly, just because of one workshop, I was categorized as a colleague of veteran and established writers. Suddenly, there was an exposure to contests, of possibly winning. And then, my poem was published. For the first time, I was published outside of my turf (my website). Suddenly, I had to write a bioâ€”a brand that summarizes who I am and what I'm trying to do.

I'm meeting all these writers, doing these walking experiments, I was really exploring and diverging. And along the way, there were several instances that I needed to synthesize and articulate my poetics.
