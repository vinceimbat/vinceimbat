Our imminent nonexistence (i.e., we are all going to die) seems to suggest that in the grander scheme of things,  [[thoughts/life is inherently meaningless]]. This does not mean, however, that we should just all commit suicide. Life can still be a worthwhile experience even if it does not have an ultimate point. In fact, [[Children don’t seem to think about purpose]] and some adults are able to live life without it ([[We can live without articulating our purpose]]).

However, for some of us who need to look for a purpose for our lives, because of some benefits ([[Benefits of articulating your purpose]]), we need to look for it not in the grand scheme of things, but in our own lives.

Our collective lives doesn’t seem to matter even if we matter to each other. But we still matter to other people and they matter to us. We can still work with this.

This should motivate us to [[Approach life with humor]].
