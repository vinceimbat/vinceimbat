# Immersion in Pangasinan Literary Community

After the wedding, I went home to Pangasinan, which was just two hours away. While there, I took the opportunity to acquaint myself with writers working in my mother tongue. I wrote a lengthy feedback to a Pangasinense writer's poems and I became officially affiliated with the Ulopan na Pamasiyansiya'y Salitan Pangasinan (UPSP), the language preservation organization of the province. I also paid a visit to the Pangasinan Polytechnic College (PPC), where a friend who has long been working in Pangasinan heritage is currently working. The meeting led to an introduction to another Pangasinense writer, who helped me understand the plight of Pangasinan literature and alternative actions we could take not just to save the language but to encourage younger writers to write about the province and their stories living there.

The conversations I had made me realize that while contributing to the preservation of my mother tongue and the flourishing of its literature remain some of the things I want to engage in, I need to find a compelling angle that would connect my current explorations in walking, photography, and spirituality with this specific project.

While in Pangasinan, I stayed a lot in Binmaley, a town filled with fishponds. I tried to beat the heat by doing some walks beside the fishponds in the late afternoons.
