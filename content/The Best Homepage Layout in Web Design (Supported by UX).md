Sliders have horrible clickthrough rates. If content is important, it shouldn't be hidden by a slider

Homepage should answer:
1. Who are you?
2. What do you do?
3. How can you help me?

If you can answer those three questions without scrolling, you're on your way to creating a positive user experience.

Must have a customer journey.
- Should funnel your customer to contacting you

4. How great you are and why they should consider you?
5. Call to action for conversion
