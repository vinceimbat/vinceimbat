Every moment something happens. Things change. It is the only true constant in the Universe. My entire life is a collection of these changes that are yet to stop. The history of humanity and the universe is a history of these changes. My own life is a product of these changes. The Spirit of Life is what makes it all go. Of course, this spirit destroys as it builds. And part of life is learning to dance with it on both of its sides. What happens, what continually happens, produces the world around me—both the good and bad, actualizes hopes and dreams. All of these are what compels me to live my life more deliberately—this mystery and miracle.
