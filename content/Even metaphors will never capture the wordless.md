When using metaphors to capture the wordless, you have to be aware that you are capturing something that cannot be captured. All attempts to capture the wordless with words is futile, even with metaphors. Using metaphors is the last tool but it is still ineffective. Because all metaphors can be converted into more direct definitions. You cannot do this with the wordless.
