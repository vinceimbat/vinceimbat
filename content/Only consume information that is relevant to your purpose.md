Information consumption is part of my workflow. The cardinal rule in my information consumption is this: I will only consume information that is relevant to my life work and current projects.

Before adding books to my [[Reading inbox]], I browse it first. Before I subscribe to a newsletter, I browse past issues first. My priority is to return to relevant information that I have encountered in the past but have not processed yet.

To process incoming relevant information, I follow [[A system to capture and filter information]].
