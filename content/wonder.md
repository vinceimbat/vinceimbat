The concepts of religion and spirituality are too hard for me to understand. What I do understand is a concept that I think is the core of both: wonder. I wonder the fact that I'm alive and so I express gratefulness. I wonder about this bird and so I write a poem about it. Others won't always feel this although everyone can access this feeling. Wonder is what inspired our ancestors to create songs about rivers, mountains, and landscapes.
