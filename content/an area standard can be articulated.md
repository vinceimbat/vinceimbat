While [[Tiago Forte]] argues that a [[life area]]â€™s standard is difficult to articulate and assess, I find that an area's standard can be articulated, with benefits.

It can be articulated as a description of a seemingly recurring [[end state]], which is different from a [[goal]], a description of a non-recurring end state. I say "seemingly recurring" because, to be philosophically precise, all end states are non-recurring, much as events cannot be repeated per se. [[mental states are similar not the same|Mental states are similar, not the same]] (see [[pursuing a mental state as a purpose requires reconstruction]]).

To say it in another way, we can write standards much like how [James Clear](craftdocs://open?blockId=A0914B11-A194-472A-9116-E349DEA7B254&spaceId=63534923-d6b9-bddc-93d1-c854ccf112a8) writes his goals: He defines what he is doing consistently, not what he has achieved.
