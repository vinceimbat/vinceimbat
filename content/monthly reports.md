The monthly report aims to present the general outlook of my past month in a single document. It presents a summary of my progress in three key areas:
1. Studies
2. Projects
3. Others

It also evaluates my major life areas: life system, physical health, mental health, relationships, sustenance, and life work.

The goal of monthly reports is to inform my goal-setting and planning for the next month and to become the main reference from which I will write [[annual reports]] and an [[annual review article]] during [[my annual review routine]].

I write it using the [[monthly report]] template. Here are the instructions on [[how to fill up the monthly report]].

Here are all the monthly reports I currently have:

- [[2020 monthly reports]]
- [[2021 monthly reports]]
- [[2022 monthly reports]]
- [[2023 monthly reports]]
- [[2024 monthly reports]]
